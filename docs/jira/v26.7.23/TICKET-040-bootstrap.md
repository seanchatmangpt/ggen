# TICKET-040: Vertical scenario: Bootstrap

## Status

PLANNED

## Parent

EPIC: InterviewAssist v26.7.23

## Source

- RDF resources:
  - `packs/wasm4pm-interview-assist-pack/ontology/40-events-workflow.ttl (<phase/created>)`
- Acceptance-test steps:
  - `acceptance-step/1 (build the system)`
  - `acceptance-step/2 (create the sandbox)`
- PRD requirements: (none)
- ARD components: (none)
- Policies: (none)
- SHACL shapes: (none)

## Objective

Prove the application builds and a fresh session reaches phase/created via a real `next build` + real sandbox-creation capability call, corresponding to acceptance-step/1 and acceptance-step/2.

## Current state

UNKNOWN — no implementation exists yet; this ticket verifies the composed system once workstreams B-H land.

## Target state

A passing Playwright/Chicago-TDD test exercising the real composed system for this scenario, using real collaborators: real `next build` process, real capability/session/create-session dispatch. No mocked core collaborator.

## Projection classification

- Template: 60%
- Domain data: admitted RDF input under packs/wasm4pm-interview-assist-pack/ontology/ — not counted as template or custom code
- Custom code: 40%
- Expected ratio: 60/40
- Custom-code justification: verification tickets are mostly test AUTHORING (a form of template-adjacent reusable test-harness code) composed with real system components; classified with a higher custom fraction than pure projection tickets because test scenario logic requires human design judgment about what to assert, though it contains zero domain data duplication — assertions reference generated types/RDF-sourced values, never restate them.

## Inputs

- the full composed system as of this scenario's dependencies

## Outputs

- examples/interview-assist/tests/e2e/bootstrap.spec.ts

Projected files are canonical source and must not be placed under `generated/`.

## Template responsibility

Shared Playwright harness (TICKET-039) and shared fixture-building utilities, reused across all 14 scenarios.

## Domain-data responsibility

Assertions reference RDF-sourced generated types/values (e.g. specific phase names, refusal codes, capability ids) rather than restating them as new literals.

## Custom-code boundary

The test itself, and any real external process it must drive (Ollama, subprocess, browser) via the workstream H adapters — no new production custom code introduced by this ticket, only test code exercising existing adapters.

## Exclusions

- no mocked core collaborator per this repo's Chicago TDD policy
- no assertion that merely counts generated files or checks a generated string for non-emptiness — must assert on real observable state
- no test skipped/marked #[ignore] to force a green run

## Implementation steps

1. Run a real `next build` (or `next dev` for the test target) against the generated application.
2. Call capability/session/create-session through the real dispatch table.
3. Assert the resulting SessionState.phase equals phase/created.

## Admission gates

- All ticket IDs in Dependencies complete.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a fresh build, when create-session is dispatched, then SessionState.phase is exactly phase/created, sourced from the real reducer, not a hand-set fixture.

## Negative tests

- Attempt to dispatch any capability before create-session and confirm it's refused (no session exists yet) rather than silently creating implicit state.

## Verification ladder

- Unit: N/A with reason — this ticket IS the integration/e2e layer, not a unit-test ticket
- Integration: composed real system, no mocks
- End-to-end: the primary layer this ticket delivers, via Playwright against a real running dev server
- Chaos: where relevant to the scenario, noted in steps above
- Stress: N/A with reason — single-scenario correctness test, not a load test
- Benchmark: N/A with reason — no perf target for this scenario
- Verifier report: Playwright test run transcript + screenshots/traces on failure

## Receipts

- test spec hash
- Playwright run transcript
- pass/fail result

## Dependencies

- TICKET-011
- TICKET-023
- TICKET-035

## Falsifier

If this scenario's test passes while any real collaborator is mocked or stubbed, the test is not a valid completion signal for this ticket — re-author with real collaborators before claiming done.

## Handoff

TICKET-053 (full decisive acceptance test) composes all 14 scenarios' proven paths into one end-to-end run.

## Definition of done

- test authored against real collaborators
- test passes against the real composed system
- no mocked core collaborator
- negative case included
