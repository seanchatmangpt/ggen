## 1. Terminology & Voice

**Word Count Target:** ~400 words

### 1.1 Formal Academic Voice

**Principle:** Maintain authoritative, scholarly tone without being pretentious or opaque.

#### Current State Analysis
The thesis currently mixes conversational and formal registers:
- ❌ "This work builds on..." (conversational)
- ✅ "This dissertation builds on..." (formal)
- ❌ "We'll explore..." (informal)
- ✅ "This chapter explores..." (formal)

#### Recommended Patterns

**For introducing work:**
```
Weak:    "This work tries to solve..."
Strong:  "This dissertation addresses..."
Strong:  "This research demonstrates..."
Strong:  "The framework presented here establishes..."
```

**For describing contributions:**
```
Weak:    "We show that..."
Strong:  "This thesis demonstrates that..."
Strong:  "Empirical evaluation shows that..."
Strong:  "The evidence indicates that..."
```

**For methodological statements:**
```
Acceptable: "We propose a framework..."
Better:     "This dissertation proposes a framework..."
Acceptable: "Our approach leverages..."
Better:     "The approach presented here leverages..."
```

### 1.2 Active vs. Passive Voice

**Recommendation:** Prefer active voice but use passive strategically.

#### When to Use Active Voice
- Describing methodology: "The generator produces type definitions" ✅
- Stating contributions: "This thesis demonstrates three key properties" ✅
- Reporting results: "The benchmarks show 94% reduction" ✅

#### When to Use Passive Voice
- De-emphasizing agent: "The ontology is transformed into schemas" ✅ (focus on ontology, not who transforms)
- Technical processes: "Types are inferred from property ranges" ✅
- Established facts: "RDF has been adopted widely" ✅

#### Examples from Current Thesis

**Current (Inconsistent):**
> "We propose a fundamentally different approach: representing API contracts as formal ontologies..."

**Revised (Consistent Active):**
> "This dissertation proposes representing API contracts as formal ontologies..."

**Current (Passive Chain - Weak):**
> "OpenAPI specifications are generated by the system, which are then validated by the pipeline, which are consumed by client generators."

**Revised (Active - Strong):**
> "The system generates OpenAPI specifications. The pipeline validates these specifications before client generators consume them."

### 1.3 Use of "We" vs. Impersonal Voice

**Current State:** Highly inconsistent across chapters
- Chapter 7 (Type Guards): Heavy use of "we", "our"
- Chapter 4 (OpenAPI): Mostly impersonal
- Chapter 3 (Templates): Mixed approach

**Recommendation:** Use impersonal constructions for consistency

#### Conversion Table

| Current "We" Form | Recommended Impersonal Form |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "We demonstrate that..." | "This thesis demonstrates that..." |
| "Our approach uses..." | "The approach uses..." |
| "We designed a system..." | "The system design incorporates..." |
| "Our experiments show..." | "Experimental results show..." |
| "We evaluated three..." | "Evaluation encompassed three..." |
| "Our framework provides..." | "The framework provides..." |

**Exception:** "We" is acceptable in:
- Abstract: "We achieve 94% reduction..."
- Conclusion: "Future work will extend..."
- Collaborative context: "In collaboration with..."

### 1.4 Terminology Consistency Checklist

**CRITICAL: Use consistent technical vocabulary**

#### Preferred Terms (Use These)

| Preferred | Avoid | Context |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **ontology** | schema (in RDF context) | RDF data models |
| **artifact** | code, file, output | Generated products |
| **implementation** | coding | Development process |
| **specification** | spec (except in compounds like "OpenAPI spec") | Formal descriptions |
| **synchronization** | syncing, sync | Keeping artifacts aligned |
| **deterministic** | repeatable, reproducible | Generation properties |
| **framework** | system (for ggen as a whole) | The ggen project |
| **component** | module (for OpenAPI) | OpenAPI sections |

#### Terminology Specific to This Thesis

**RDF/Ontology Terms:**
- "RDF ontology" not "RDF schema" (schema is SQL/XML)
- "triple" not "statement" (RDF-specific term)
- "property" not "attribute" (RDF terminology)
- "class" not "entity type" (OWL terminology)

**Code Generation Terms:**
- "artifact generation" not "code production"
- "template rendering" not "template processing"
- "SPARQL query execution" not "SPARQL processing"
- "type inference" not "type derivation"

**API Terms:**
- "API contract" not "API specification" (emphasizes agreement)
- "endpoint definition" not "route definition"
- "request schema" not "input schema"
- "validation constraint" not "validation rule"

### 1.5 Domain-Specific Glossary References

**Mandatory:** Define all acronyms on first use in each chapter

**Pattern:**
```
First use:     "Resource Description Framework (RDF)"
Subsequent:    "RDF" or "the RDF model"

First use:     "SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)"
Subsequent:    "SPARQL" or "SPARQL queries"

First use:     "Application Programming Interface (API)"
Subsequent:    "API" or "the API contract"
```

**Cross-Reference to Glossary:**
```
"See Glossary: RDF Ontology" (when introducing complex concept)
"As defined in Section 1.2..." (for concepts defined earlier)
"\textit{Type guard} (see Section 7.1) refers to..." (inline definition with reference)
```

---

## 2. Sentence Structure & Clarity

**Word Count Target:** ~400 words

### 2.1 Sentence Length Guidelines

**Target:** Average 20 words, maximum 30 words per sentence

#### Current Issues Identified

**Example 1 - Too Long (47 words):**
> "The generation of API contracts from ontological specifications introduces a critical challenge at the intersection of static type systems and runtime behavior, requiring a mechanism to validate runtime data against types derived from our ontological specifications."

**Revision (Two sentences, 22 + 18 words):**
> "Generating API contracts from ontological specifications introduces a critical challenge: bridging static type systems and runtime behavior. This requires mechanisms to validate runtime data against types derived from ontological specifications."

**Example 2 - Too Long (38 words):**
> "Modern software development, particularly in the domain of distributed systems and web services, relies heavily on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the primary mechanism for inter-service communication."

**Revision (Split into two, 15 + 18 words):**
> "Modern distributed systems rely heavily on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for inter-service communication. APIs serve as the primary contract mechanism in web services architectures."

### 2.2 Eliminating Passive Voice Chains

**Problem Pattern:** Multiple passives in sequence obscure agency

**Before (Passive Chain):**
> "The ontology is transformed by SPARQL queries into structured data, which is then processed by Tera templates, which are ultimately rendered into code artifacts."

**After (Active, Clear Agency):**
> "SPARQL queries transform the ontology into structured data. Tera templates process this data and render code artifacts."

**Before (Weak Passive):**
> "It has been demonstrated that ontology-driven generation can be used to reduce errors."

**After (Strong Active):**
> "Empirical evaluation demonstrates that ontology-driven generation reduces errors by 94%."

### 2.3 Eliminating Weak Openings

**Common Weak Patterns to Avoid:**

| Weak Opening | Stronger Alternative |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "It is important to note that..." | State directly: "RDF provides..." |
| "It should be noted that..." | Delete and state fact |
| "It is interesting that..." | "Notably," or omit |
| "There are several reasons why..." | "Three factors contribute..." |
| "There is a need for..." | "The system requires..." |
| "One of the key features is..." | "The key feature is..." or list directly |

**Examples:**

**Before:**
> "It is important to note that type guards provide runtime validation in addition to static type checking."

**After:**
> "Type guards provide runtime validation in addition to static type checking."

**Before:**
> "There are three main approaches to code generation that have been explored in prior work."

**After:**
> "Prior work explores three code generation approaches: template-based, model-driven, and grammar-based."

### 2.4 Clarifying Vague Pronouns

**Problem:** "This", "it", "which" without clear antecedent

**Before (Ambiguous "This"):**
> "The system generates schemas from ontologies. This ensures consistency across artifacts."

**After (Clear Antecedent):**
> "The system generates schemas from ontologies. This generation process ensures consistency across artifacts."

**Before (Ambiguous "Which"):**
> "Templates render SPARQL results, which enables deterministic generation."

**After:**
> "Templates render SPARQL results. This rendering approach enables deterministic generation."

### 2.5 Using Strong Verbs

**Principle:** Replace weak verbs with precise, active alternatives

#### Verb Replacement Table

| Weak Verb | Strong Alternative | Example Context |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| makes use of | uses, leverages, employs | "The system **uses** RDF" |
| provides the ability to | enables, allows, supports | "Zod **enables** runtime validation" |
| has the capability of | can, supports | "Templates **can** generate multiple files" |
| is able to | can | "The generator **can** infer types" |
| shows evidence for | demonstrates, proves, establishes | "Benchmarks **demonstrate** performance gains" |
| appears to be | is, seems | "The approach **is** effective" |
| seems to suggest | suggests, indicates | "Results **indicate** 94% improvement" |

**Before:**
> "The framework makes use of SPARQL queries to provide the ability to extract data."

**After:**
> "The framework uses SPARQL queries to extract data."

### 2.6 Common Revision Patterns

**Pattern 1: Nominalization Reduction**
```
Before: "The implementation of validation occurs after generation."
After:  "Validation occurs after generation."
After:  "The system validates artifacts after generating them."
```

**Pattern 2: Prepositional Phrase Reduction**
```
Before: "The purpose of this chapter is to explore the generation of type guards."
After:  "This chapter explores type guard generation."
```

**Pattern 3: Hedging Removal**
```
Before: "The results appear to suggest that the approach seems effective."
After:  "The results show the approach is effective."
```

---

## 3. Paragraph Organization

**Word Count Target:** ~300 words

### 3.1 Topic Sentence Guidelines

**Principle:** Every paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence stating the main claim.

#### Current Issue Analysis

**Problem Pattern - Buried Topic:**
> "RDF provides a standard model for data interchange. SPARQL enables querying. Tera handles template rendering. Together, these technologies form the foundation of the generation pipeline."

**Revision - Topic First:**
> "Three technologies form the foundation of the generation pipeline: RDF for data modeling, SPARQL for querying, and Tera for rendering. RDF provides... [details follow]"

#### Topic Sentence Templates

**For introducing concepts:**
```
"[Concept] addresses [problem] through [mechanism]."
"Three properties characterize [concept]: [list]."
"[Concept] differs from [alternative] in [key way]."
```

**For presenting results:**
```
"Evaluation demonstrates [finding] across [contexts]."
"Three metrics measure [aspect]: [list]."
"Performance analysis reveals [pattern]."
```

**For methodological descriptions:**
```
"The generation pipeline consists of [N] stages."
"Two design decisions shape [component]: [list]."
"The architecture separates [concern A] from [concern B]."
```

### 3.2 Paragraph Cohesion Techniques

#### Transitional Phrases by Function

**Adding information:**
- Furthermore,
- Additionally,
- Moreover,
- In addition to [X],

**Contrasting:**
- In contrast,
- Conversely,
- However,
- On the other hand,
- Unlike [X],

**Showing cause/effect:**
- As a result,
- Consequently,
- Therefore,
- This enables...
- This leads to...

**Providing examples:**
- For instance,
- Specifically,
- Consider the case where...
- Listing \ref{lst:example} demonstrates...

**Showing sequence:**
- First, / Second, / Finally,
- Subsequently,
- Following this,
- The next stage involves...

#### Linking Sentences with Repetition

**Pattern:** Repeat keywords or use pronouns to connect ideas

**Example:**
> "The generator produces TypeScript interfaces. **These interfaces** incorporate constraints from the RDF specification. **The constraints** ensure runtime validation aligns with type definitions."

(Note: "interfaces" → "These interfaces" → "constraints" → "The constraints")

### 3.3 Paragraph Length Guidelines

**Target Distribution:**
- **Most paragraphs:** 3-5 sentences (75-150 words)
- **Complex topics:** 5-7 sentences (150-200 words)
- **Transitional:** 1-2 sentences (acceptable for transitions)
- **Maximum:** 7 sentences (if longer, split)

#### Current State Issues

**Chapter 7, Introduction - Too Long (15 sentences, ~250 words):**
Should be split into 2-3 paragraphs:
1. Problem statement (motivation)
2. Proposed solution (type guards)
3. Chapter scope/organization

**Main Thesis, Section 1.2 - Too Short (2 sentences repeated pattern):**
Several 2-sentence paragraphs should be combined or expanded.

### 3.4 One Main Idea Per Paragraph

**Diagnostic Question:** Can you summarize the paragraph in one sentence?

**Problem Example (Two Ideas):**
> "Templates use Tera for rendering. SPARQL queries extract data from RDF ontologies. The combination enables deterministic generation. Validation occurs through JSON Schema. Error handling uses Result types in Rust."

**Revision (Split into Two Paragraphs):**

**Paragraph 1 (Query & Render):**
> "The generation pipeline combines SPARQL queries and Tera templates to enable deterministic artifact production. SPARQL extracts structured data from RDF ontologies. Tera renders this data into target language syntax."

**Paragraph 2 (Validation & Error Handling):**
> "Two mechanisms ensure generation reliability: JSON Schema validation and Rust's Result types. Validation checks intermediate data structures. Result types handle errors without exceptions."

---

## 4. Technical Writing & Precision

**Word Count Target:** ~400 words

### 4.1 Precision in Technical Claims

**Principle:** Always provide specific, measurable evidence for claims.

#### Vague vs. Precise Patterns

| Vague Claim | Precise Revision |
|-------------|------------------|
| "The system is efficient." | "Generation averages 50ms for 500-triple ontologies." |
| "Type checking is improved." | "Type errors decrease by 40% due to exhaustive pattern matching." |
| "The framework performs well." | "Throughput reaches 1,200 requests/second at p95 latency of 15ms." |
| "Ontology-driven generation reduces errors." | "Synchronization errors decrease by 94% compared to hand-written code." |
| "The approach scales effectively." | "The system handles ontologies with 10,000+ triples with sub-second generation." |

#### Adding Specificity to Current Thesis

**Current (Vague):**
> "The framework architecture cleanly separates concerns."

**Revised (Specific):**
> "The architecture separates three concerns: ontology modeling (RDF), data extraction (SPARQL), and rendering (Tera templates)."

**Current (Vague):**
> "Developer productivity is improved significantly."

**Revised (Specific):**
> "API evolution tasks complete 55-80% faster, from an average of 4.2 hours to 1.2 hours, as measured across 15 development scenarios."

### 4.2 Metric Presentation Guidelines

**Always accompany quantitative claims with evidence or citation.**

#### Formatting Metrics

**Performance Metrics:**
```
✅ "Generation time: 50ms average, 95th percentile 120ms (n=1000)"
✅ "Throughput: 1,200 req/s (measured under 4-core, 8GB RAM)"
❌ "Generation is fast"
```

**Accuracy Metrics:**
```
✅ "Type errors reduced by 40% (120/300 → 72/300 test cases)"
✅ "Synchronization reliability: 100% (0 inconsistencies in 500 generations)"
❌ "Type checking is better"
```

**Comparison Metrics:**
```
✅ "55-80% reduction in development time (traditional: 4.2h, ontology-driven: 1.2h)"
✅ "89% of contract violations caught at compile-time vs. 34% with manual schemas"
❌ "Much faster than before"
```

### 4.3 Code Examples and Listings

**Every code example must be:**
1. Introduced in prose
2. Numbered for reference
3. Captioned descriptively
4. Discussed after presentation

#### Pattern for Introducing Code

```latex
\textbf{Before (No Introduction):}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
pub fn generate() { ... }
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{After (Proper Introduction):}
The generator implements a two-phase pipeline, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:generator}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=rust,
  caption={Two-phase generation pipeline implementation},
  label=lst:generator
]
pub fn generate() { ... }
\end{lstlisting}

Listing~\ref{lst:generator} separates query execution (lines 2-5) from template rendering (lines 7-12).
```

#### Caption Quality Standards

**Weak Captions:**
- ❌ "Code example"
- ❌ "Generator function"
- ❌ "Listing 3"

**Strong Captions:**
- ✅ "Two-phase generation pipeline with query execution and rendering"
- ✅ "SPARQL query extracting entity properties with cardinality constraints"
- ✅ "Generated TypeScript interface with JSDoc annotations and Zod schema"

### 4.4 Definition Clarity

#### Acronym Definition Pattern

**First use in each chapter:**
```
"Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides..."
```

**Subsequent uses:**
```
"RDF triples encode..."
"The RDF model supports..."
```

**In abstracts and chapter introductions:**
Always define, even if defined elsewhere.

#### Technical Term Introduction

**Pattern:**
```
"\textit{Type guard}: A runtime function that validates whether a value conforms to a type while informing the type system of the refinement."
```

**With glossary reference:**
```
"Type guards (see Glossary: Type Guard, p. XX) provide runtime validation."
```

#### Avoiding Assumed Knowledge

**Problem:**
> "SHACL shapes constrain property values."

**Better (Define SHACL):**
> "Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) shapes define constraints on RDF property values, including cardinality, datatype, and pattern restrictions."

**Problem:**
> "The system uses Tera for rendering."

**Better (Context for Tera):**
> "The system uses Tera, a Rust template engine inspired by Jinja2, for rendering code artifacts from SPARQL query results."

---

## 5. Academic Conventions

**Word Count Target:** ~300 words

### 5.1 Citation Practices

**Current State:** Only 10 bibliography entries (low for 50K-word thesis)

**Target:** 40-60 citations minimum for a comprehensive dissertation

#### Where to Add Citations

**Foundational Claims:**
```
Before: "RDF has been widely adopted in semantic web applications."
After:  "RDF has been widely adopted in semantic web applications \cite{berners2001semantic,allemang2011semantic}."
```

**Prior Work Comparison:**
```
Before: "Previous code generation approaches suffer from drift."
After:  "Previous code generation approaches suffer from specification-implementation drift \cite{czarnecki2000generative,völter2013model}."
```

**Established Techniques:**
```
Before: "SPARQL provides graph pattern matching."
After:  "SPARQL provides graph pattern matching through basic graph patterns and OPTIONAL clauses \cite{w3c2013sparql11}."
```

**Performance Benchmarks:**
```
Before: "Graph databases scale to millions of triples."
After:  "Graph databases scale to millions of triples while maintaining query performance \cite{angles2018foundations,hartig2014database}."
```

### 5.2 Tense Usage Guidelines

#### Present Tense (Established Facts)
```
"RDF uses a triple model to represent knowledge."
"SPARQL provides four query forms: SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, DESCRIBE."
"The semantic web relies on formal ontologies."
```

#### Past Tense (Work Performed)
```
"We evaluated three approaches across 15 scenarios."
"Experiments measured generation time and artifact consistency."
"The study compared ontology-driven generation with manual development."
```

#### Present Perfect (Ongoing Impact)
```
"GraphQL has become widely adopted for API design."
"The Linked Data movement has established best practices."
"Research has shown that formal specifications reduce errors."
```

#### Future Tense (Proposed Work)
```
"Future work will extend the framework to support GraphQL."
"Additional research will explore AI-assisted ontology construction."
"Subsequent studies will validate the approach in industrial settings."
```

### 5.3 First Person vs. Passive

**Academic Writing Allows First Person for:**
- Methodology: "We propose a framework..."
- Contributions: "This thesis demonstrates..."
- Decisions: "We chose SPARQL for its standardization..."
- Future Work: "We plan to extend..."

**Avoid First Person for:**
- Opinions: ❌ "We think RDF is better..." → ✅ "Evidence suggests RDF provides..."
- Beliefs: ❌ "We believe this approach..." → ✅ "The results indicate..."
- Subjective: ❌ "We feel confident..." → ✅ "Evaluation demonstrates..."

### 5.4 Comparative Language Standards

**Always provide basis for comparisons:**

| Vague Comparison | Specific Comparison |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "better performance" | "25% faster (1.2h vs. 1.6h)" |
| "more concise code" | "40% fewer lines (1,200 vs. 2,000 LOC)" |
| "improved type safety" | "89% of errors caught at compile-time vs. 34%" |

**Avoid subjective intensifiers:**
- ❌ "obviously faster"
- ❌ "clearly superior"
- ❌ "much better"

**Use evidence-based qualifiers:**
- ✅ "measurably faster (2.3x speedup)"
- ✅ "demonstrably more reliable (0 failures vs. 12)"
- ✅ "significantly more concise (p < 0.01)"

## 6. Chapter-Specific Guidance

**Word Count Target:** ~300 words

### 6.1 Introduction Chapter (Chapter 1)

**Current Strengths:**
- Clear problem statement with multiple sources of truth example
- Good motivation with concrete consequences
- Thesis statement explicitly stated

**Areas for Enhancement:**

**Research Contributions Statement:**
```
Current: Scattered throughout introduction
Better:  Dedicated subsection (1.X) listing contributions
Format:
  "This dissertation makes four primary contributions:
   1. A systematic mapping from RDF ontologies to OpenAPI specifications...
   2. A template-based generation architecture achieving 100% reproducibility...
   3. Empirical validation demonstrating 94% reduction in synchronization errors...
   4. Integration patterns for full-stack type safety spanning..."
```

**Preview of Chapters:**
```
Current: Brief description-based list
Better:  Highlight key contribution in each chapter
Format:
  "Chapter 2 establishes the theoretical foundation by demonstrating how SPARQL's graph pattern matching enables deterministic data extraction..."
```

### 6.2 Related Work Chapter (Missing - To Be Added)

**Required Structure:**
1. **Taxonomy of Approaches** (not just chronological summary)
2. **Positioning Statement** for each area
3. **Gap Analysis** showing what's missing
4. **Comparative Table** summarizing differences

**Pattern for Each Subsection:**
```
Subsection Title: "Template-Based Code Generation"

Prior Work Summary:
"Template-based approaches have focused on..."

Limitations:
"However, these approaches fail to address..."

This Work's Contribution:
"In contrast, this dissertation demonstrates..."
```

### 6.3 Technical Chapters (Chapters 2-8)

**Pattern for Consistency:**

**Introduction Paragraph:**
```
Weak:  "This chapter explores templates."
Strong: "Templates bridge the gap between SPARQL query results and executable artifacts. This chapter presents the architectural design of the template system, demonstrates code generation patterns, and evaluates performance characteristics."
```

**Theory → Intuition → Example Pattern:**

```
1. Formal Definition (if applicable):
   "A type guard is a function g: unknown → boolean..."

2. Intuitive Explanation:
   "Intuitively, type guards validate object shapes at runtime..."

3. Code Example:
   "Listing X.Y demonstrates a type guard for the User entity..."

4. Discussion:
   "This implementation checks three properties..."
```

**Balance Rigor with Accessibility:**
- Include formal definitions but don't let them dominate
- Follow math with plain language explanation
- Use code examples to ground abstract concepts

### 6.4 Case Studies Chapter

**Current State:** One Blog API example

**Enhancement Strategy:**

**For Each Case Study:**
1. **Problem Statement:** What API/domain is being modeled?
2. **Domain Modeling:** How were entities and relationships captured?
3. **Specification:** Show key RDF triples
4. **Generation:** SPARQL queries and template excerpts
5. **Results:** Metrics and observations
6. **Lessons Learned:** What worked, what didn't

**Ensure Consistency:**
- All case studies follow same structure
- All include quantitative results
- All discuss trade-offs

### 6.5 Conclusion Chapter

**Current Weaknesses:** Needs expansion, weak limitations

**Required Sections:**

**Contributions Summary (Restated):**
```
"This dissertation demonstrated four key results:
 1. RDF ontologies provide sufficient semantic richness for API contract generation (Section X.Y)
 2. Deterministic generation is achievable through SPARQL + templates (Chapter 3)
 3. Full-stack type safety can be derived from a single ontological source (Chapters 5-8)
 4. Ontology-driven generation reduces errors by 94% compared to manual approaches (Chapter 9)"
```

**Limitations (Expanded):**
```
Current: 4 bullet points, vague
Better:  Detailed subsection discussing:
 - Technical limitations (e.g., SPARQL query complexity scaling)
 - Adoption barriers (e.g., RDF/SPARQL learning curve)
 - Scope constraints (e.g., focus on REST, not GraphQL)
 - Evaluation limitations (e.g., single-organization study)
```

**Future Work (Specific):**
```
Current: General directions
Better:  Concrete next steps with success criteria:
 "GraphQL Integration: Extend the framework to generate GraphQL schemas and resolvers. Success criteria: equivalent type safety guarantees and <100ms generation for typical schemas."
```

## Example Before/After Transformations

### Example 1: Vague to Precise

**Before:**
> "The framework performs well and is efficient. Type safety is improved significantly."

**After:**
> "The framework generates artifacts in 50ms average (95th percentile: 120ms, n=1,000). Type safety improves 40%, with compile-time detection increasing from 34% to 89% of contract violations."

### Example 2: Weak Opening to Strong

**Before:**
> "It is important to note that there are several challenges in code generation. These challenges include maintaining synchronization, ensuring type safety, and handling complexity."

**After:**
> "Code generation faces three primary challenges: maintaining artifact synchronization, ensuring type safety across language boundaries, and managing complexity in large ontologies. This thesis addresses each challenge through ontology-driven generation."

### Example 3: Passive Chain to Active

**Before:**
> "RDF ontologies are transformed by SPARQL queries, which are then processed by Tera templates, which are ultimately consumed by code generators."

**After:**
> "SPARQL queries transform RDF ontologies into structured data. Tera templates process this data and generate code artifacts."

### Example 4: Inconsistent Voice to Consistent

**Before (Mixed):**
> "We propose a framework that generates types. The system uses SPARQL for querying. Our approach ensures consistency."

**After (Consistent Impersonal):**
> "This thesis proposes a framework that generates types. The system uses SPARQL for querying. The approach ensures consistency."

### Example 5: Long Sentence to Split

**Before (38 words):**
> "The generation of API contracts from ontological specifications introduces a critical challenge at the intersection of static type systems and runtime behavior, requiring a mechanism to validate runtime data against types derived from ontological specifications."

**After (Two sentences, 15 + 20 words):**
> "Generating API contracts from ontological specifications introduces a critical challenge: bridging static type systems and runtime behavior. This bridge requires mechanisms to validate runtime data against types derived from ontological specifications."
