## Integration Guide

### Three Options for Remaining Phases:

#### Option A: Automated Completion (2-3 hours)
Run integration script to insert all remaining content:
```bash
# Would involve:
# 1. Insert Evaluation & Methodology (before line 1193)
# 2. Expand Case Studies (within case study chapter)
# 3. Expand Limitations (replace conclusions section)
# 4. Replace bibliography (lines 1600-1619)
# 5. Add glossary (before appendices)
# 6. Final compile and validation
```

#### Option B: Manual Integration (4-6 hours)
Use the detailed `MAX-DEPTH-THESIS-GUIDE.md` to integrate each section:
- Read each enhancement file
- Manually insert at specified line numbers
- Update cross-references and citations
- Test compilation

#### Option C: Staged Integration (8+ weeks)
Integrate one section per week using the integration guide:
- Week 1: Bibliography expansion
- Week 2: Glossary
- Week 3: Evaluation & Methodology
- Week 4: Additional case studies
- Week 5: Expanded limitations
- Week 6: Final review and polish
