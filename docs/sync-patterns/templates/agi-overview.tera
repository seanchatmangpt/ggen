## Overview

This framework maps how ggen sync patterns enable AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capabilities. Each pattern contributes to one or more cognitive abilities organized across five levels.

---

## Cognitive Levels

```
AUTONOMY (Level 5)
    └─ Self-reflection, meta-cognition, adaptive behavior

PLANNING (Level 4)
    └─ Goal-directed generation, hypothetical reasoning

LEARNING (Level 3)
    └─ Knowledge acquisition, strategy adaptation

REASONING (Level 2)
    └─ Deduction, induction, abduction, analogy

PERCEPTION (Level 1)
    └─ Knowledge representation, abstraction
```

## Reasoning Mode Distribution

The framework supports four primary reasoning modes:

### Deductive Reasoning 🔵
**Patterns**: THE SINGLE COMMAND, MANIFEST AS TRUTH, THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE, INFERENCE ENRICHMENT, TEMPLATE RENDERING, VALIDATION GATE, TIMEOUT PROTECTION, DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT, PIPELINE STATE

Derives specific conclusions from general premises through logical inference.

### Inductive Reasoning 🟢
**Patterns**: ONTOLOGY LOADING

Identifies generalizable patterns from specific examples in the knowledge graph.

### Abductive Reasoning 🟡
**Patterns**: GENERATION RULES, DRY RUN, ERROR SIGNALS

Forms hypotheses to explain observations and diagnose issues.

### Analogical Reasoning 🔴
**Patterns**: FORCE OVERWRITE, AUDIT TRAIL, RULE SELECTION

Maps solutions across domains by recognizing structural similarities.

## Learning Strategy Coverage

| Strategy | Patterns | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Supervised** | MANIFEST AS TRUTH, GENERATION RULES, TEMPLATE RENDERING, VALIDATION GATE, DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT, AUDIT TRAIL, PIPELINE STATE | Learning guided by explicit rules |
| **Unsupervised** | ONTOLOGY LOADING, INFERENCE ENRICHMENT | Discovering structure without guidance |
| **Reinforcement** | DRY RUN, ERROR SIGNALS, RULE SELECTION | Learning from outcomes and feedback |
| **Meta-Learning** | THE SINGLE COMMAND, THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE, FORCE OVERWRITE, TIMEOUT PROTECTION | Learning how to learn |

## Capability Hierarchy

### Foundation Layer (Perception)
- **Knowledge Representation** ← ONTOLOGY LOADING, MANIFEST AS TRUTH
- **Cognitive Abstraction** ← THE SINGLE COMMAND

### Reasoning Layer
- **Knowledge Enrichment** ← INFERENCE ENRICHMENT
- **Hierarchical Reasoning** ← THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE
- **Robust Reasoning** ← ERROR SIGNALS, VALIDATION GATE

### Planning Layer
- **Goal-Directed Generation** ← GENERATION RULES, TEMPLATE RENDERING, RULE SELECTION
- **Hypothetical Reasoning** ← DRY RUN
- **Bounded Rationality** ← TIMEOUT PROTECTION, FORCE OVERWRITE

### Autonomy Layer
- **Execution Reflection** ← AUDIT TRAIL, PIPELINE STATE
- **Deterministic Behavior** ← DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT

---

## Getting Started

1. **Foundation**: Begin with ONTOLOGY LOADING and MANIFEST AS TRUTH
2. **Reasoning**: Add INFERENCE ENRICHMENT for knowledge derivation
3. **Generation**: Implement GENERATION RULES for output production
4. **Safety**: Enable DRY RUN and VALIDATION GATE for safe exploration
5. **Reflection**: Add AUDIT TRAIL for meta-cognitive capabilities

---

## Key Insights

- **Pattern Synergy**: Each pattern enables multiple AGI capabilities
- **Layered Development**: Build from perception → reasoning → planning → autonomy
- **Determinism**: All reasoning is reproducible through DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT
- **Meta-Cognition**: AUDIT TRAIL enables self-reflection and improvement
