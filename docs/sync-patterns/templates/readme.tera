# A Pattern Language for ggen sync

> *"Every pattern we define must be formulated in the form of a rule which establishes a relationship between a context, a system of forces which arises in that context, and a configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves."*

## What This Book Contains

This book presents **ggen sync** as a pattern language—a connected network of design solutions that, when woven together, create a living system for transforming domain knowledge into code.

Unlike reference documentation that tells you *what* each flag does, this pattern language explains *why* the system is shaped as it is, *when* each pattern applies, and *how* the patterns support one another to create wholeness.

## The Central Pattern

At the heart of this language lies a single, powerful idea:

**Code generation should be a synchronization of truth.**

Your domain knowledge—expressed as ontologies, rules, and templates—is the source. The generated code is merely a projection of that truth into a form that machines can execute. When the knowledge changes, the code changes. When the code exists, it reflects exactly what the knowledge declares.

This is what **ggen sync** does. It synchronizes.

---

## The Quality Without a Name

A code generation system possesses the "quality without a name" when:

- **It is alive**: Changes to domain knowledge flow naturally into code changes
- **It is whole**: Every part serves the whole; nothing is extraneous
- **It is comfortable**: Developers trust it, understand it, feel at ease using it
- **It is free**: The system does not constrain; it liberates
- **It is exact**: Outputs are precise, reproducible, deterministic
- **It is egoless**: The system serves the domain, not itself
- **It is eternal**: The patterns remain valid as the system evolves

---

## Pattern Categories

### Foundation Patterns (1-3)
Establish what ggen sync is, how it is configured, and how it is structured.

### Knowledge Patterns (4-7)
Govern how domain truth enters the system and becomes code.

### Safety Patterns (8-12)
Protect developers, systems, and outputs from harm.

### Integrity Patterns (13-15)
Ensure trust in the system's outputs through reproducibility and auditability.

### Selective Patterns (16)
Allow focused, intentional operation when needed.

## The Confidence Stars

Each pattern name is followed by one to three stars:

| Stars | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `*` | **Emerging** — Promising but still evolving |
| `**` | **Established** — Proven in practice |
| `***` | **Fundamental** — Essential to the language |

---

## Begin Here

If you are new to ggen sync, start with these three patterns:

1. **[THE SINGLE COMMAND](patterns/01-single-command.md)** — Understand the unified nature of the system
2. **[MANIFEST AS TRUTH](patterns/02-manifest-as-truth.md)** — See how configuration declares intent
3. **[DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT](patterns/13-deterministic-output.md)** — Grasp why reproducibility matters

Then explore the **[Pattern Map](pattern-map.md)** to find your path through the remaining patterns based on your needs.

## This Book Was Generated

This entire mdBook was generated using ggen sync itself:

```
ontology/pattern-language.ttl  →  ggen sync  →  src/*.md
         (Turtle)                  (3T)           (mdBook)
```

The patterns, connections, and glossary terms are all defined in RDF. SPARQL queries extract the data. Tera templates shape the output. ggen sync orchestrates the transformation.

**The book documents the tool. The tool generates the book.**

This is the power of knowledge-driven code generation.
