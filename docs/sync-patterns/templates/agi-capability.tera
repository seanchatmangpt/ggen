# {{ capabilityLabel }}

**Capability ID**: `{{ capabilityId }}`
**Cognitive Level**: {{ cognitiveLevel | default(value="reasoning") | title }}
**Maturity**: {% if maturityLevel == 3 %}🔵 Fundamental{% elif maturityLevel == 2 %}🟢 Established{% else %}🟡 Emerging{% endif %}

## Overview

{{ description | default(value="This capability enables advanced reasoning and knowledge processing.") }}

---

## Enabling Patterns

{% if requiresPatternLabel %}
This capability is primarily enabled by:

- **[{{ requiresPatternNumber }}. {{ requiresPatternLabel }}]({{ requiresPatternNumber | slugify }}-{{ requiresPatternLabel | lower | replace(from=" ", to="-") }}.md)**
{% endif %}

{% if prerequisites %}
### Prerequisites

Before developing this capability, ensure you have:

{% for prereq in prerequisites | split(pat="|") %}
- [`{{ prereq }}`]({{ prereq | slugify }}.md)
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## Reasoning Support

{% if reasoningModeLabel %}
**Primary Reasoning Mode**: {{ reasoningModeLabel }}

{% if reasoningModeLabel == "Deductive Reasoning" %}
This capability uses **deductive reasoning** - deriving specific conclusions from general premises. In ggen, this manifests through CONSTRUCT queries and type inference.
{% elif reasoningModeLabel == "Inductive Reasoning" %}
This capability uses **inductive reasoning** - identifying generalizable patterns from specific examples. This enables pattern detection and knowledge generalization.
{% elif reasoningModeLabel == "Abductive Reasoning" %}
This capability uses **abductive reasoning** - forming hypotheses to explain observations. This powers error diagnosis and root cause analysis.
{% elif reasoningModeLabel == "Analogical Reasoning" %}
This capability uses **analogical reasoning** - mapping solutions across domains by structural similarity. This enables template reuse and cross-domain pattern application.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

---

## Learning Strategy

{% if learningStrategyLabel %}
**Primary Learning Approach**: {{ learningStrategyLabel }}

{% if learningStrategyLabel == "Supervised Learning" %}
Learning is guided by explicit rules and manifests. The system follows declared configurations.
{% elif learningStrategyLabel == "Unsupervised Learning" %}
The system discovers structure in raw knowledge without explicit guidance.
{% elif learningStrategyLabel == "Reinforcement Learning" %}
Learning occurs through outcomes and feedback, improving through iteration.
{% elif learningStrategyLabel == "Meta-Learning" %}
The system learns how to learn, understanding its own structure and adaptation mechanisms.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

---

## Knowledge Types

{% if knowledgeTypes %}
This capability works with the following knowledge types:

{% for kt in knowledgeTypes | split(pat="|") %}
- **{{ kt }}**
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## Capability Relationships

{% if enhancedBy %}
### Enhanced By

This capability is strengthened by:

{% for enhancer in enhancedBy | split(pat="|") %}
- [`{{ enhancer }}`]({{ enhancer | slugify }}.md)
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## Implementation Notes

To develop this capability in your ggen project:

1. **Ensure patterns are implemented**: Start with the enabling pattern
2. **Configure the manifest**: Set up `ggen.toml` with appropriate rules
3. **Define ontology**: Create RDF structures that leverage this capability
4. **Test with dry-run**: Validate reasoning chains before execution
