# Reasoning Chains: Pattern → Capability

This document visualizes how sync patterns chain together to enable AGI capabilities through connected reasoning flows.

---

## Chain Overview

Patterns connect through explicit relationships that form reasoning chains. Each chain transforms knowledge from one form to another, building toward higher-level capabilities.

---

## Primary Reasoning Chains

### Chain 1: Knowledge Acquisition → Enrichment → Generation

```
MANIFEST AS TRUTH
    │ configures
    ▼
ONTOLOGY LOADING
    │ enables
    ▼
INFERENCE ENRICHMENT
    │ enables
    ▼
GENERATION RULES
    │ invokes
    ▼
TEMPLATE RENDERING
    │
    ▼
[Generated Code]
```

**Knowledge Transformation**:
- Declarative → Semantic → Procedural → Executable

**Reasoning Modes**: Deductive → Inductive → Deductive → Abductive

---

### Chain 2: Command → Safety → Execution

```
THE SINGLE COMMAND
    │ requires
    ▼
MANIFEST AS TRUTH
    │ modified-by
    ▼
DRY RUN ────────► Preview
    │
    ▼
VALIDATION GATE ─► Fail Fast
    │
    ▼
FORCE OVERWRITE ─► Override
    │
    ▼
[Execution]
```

**Cognitive Progression**:
- Abstraction → Configuration → Simulation → Validation → Action

---

### Chain 3: Execution → Reflection → Improvement

```
GENERATION RULES
    │ produces
    ▼
PIPELINE STATE
    │ serializes
    ▼
AUDIT TRAIL
    │ enables
    ▼
[Meta-Cognition]
    │
    ▼
[Self-Improvement]
```

**Knowledge Flow**:
- Procedural → Episodic → Meta-Knowledge → Adaptive

## Pattern Connection Details

{% for row in results %}
### {{ row.sourcePatternNumber }}. {{ row.sourcePatternLabel }} → {{ row.targetPatternNumber }}. {{ row.targetPatternLabel }}

**Connection Type**: `{{ row.connectionType }}`

**Reason**: {{ row.chainDescription | default(value="Enables next pattern in chain") }}

| Aspect | Source | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Capability | {{ row.sourceCapabilityLabel | default(value="-") }} | {{ row.targetCapabilityLabel | default(value="-") }} |
| Reasoning | {{ row.sourceReasoningMode | default(value="-") }} | {{ row.targetReasoningMode | default(value="-") }} |

## Chain Analysis

### Connection Types

| Type | Meaning | Count |
|------|---------|-------|
| `requires` | Must have before | Foundation |
| `configures` | Sets parameters for | Configuration |
| `enables` | Makes possible | Enablement |
| `modified-by` | Behavior changed by | Modification |
| `implemented-by` | Realized through | Implementation |
| `invokes` | Directly calls | Invocation |
| `reports` | Communicates to | Feedback |
| `verifies` | Validates output of | Verification |
| `serializes` | Records state of | Persistence |

---

## Critical Paths

### Shortest Path to Code Generation
1. MANIFEST AS TRUTH → ONTOLOGY LOADING → GENERATION RULES

### Shortest Path to Meta-Cognition
1. GENERATION RULES → PIPELINE STATE → AUDIT TRAIL

### Path to Robust Reasoning
1. THE SINGLE COMMAND → VALIDATION GATE → ERROR SIGNALS

## Knowledge Transformations

| Stage | Input Knowledge | Transformation | Output Knowledge |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Loading | Raw TTL files | Parsing | RDF Graph |
| Inference | Explicit facts | CONSTRUCT | Derived facts |
| Query | Full graph | SELECT | Variable bindings |
| Rendering | Bindings | Template | Source code |
| Audit | Execution | Serialization | Evidence trail |
