# How to Use This Pattern Language

> *"The patterns are not isolated. They form a language. And the language is generative."*

## Reading the Patterns

Each pattern in this book represents a recurring solution to a recurring problem in code synchronization. The patterns are not rules to follow blindly—they are **relationships** between context, forces, and resolution.

### The Pattern Structure

Every pattern follows this form:

```
PATTERN NAME [confidence stars]

[An evocative image that sets the scene]

Context:
    The situation where this pattern applies

❖ ❖ ❖

Problem:
    The forces that create tension

Therefore:
    The action that resolves the forces

❖ ❖ ❖

Implementation:
    How ggen sync realizes this pattern

The Deeper Pattern:
    Philosophical significance

Connections:
    Related patterns
```

## Navigation Strategies

### By Need

| If you need to... | Start with... |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Understand what ggen sync does | Pattern 1: THE SINGLE COMMAND |
| Configure a project | Pattern 2: MANIFEST AS TRUTH |
| Work with ontologies | Pattern 4: ONTOLOGY LOADING |
| Define transformations | Pattern 6: GENERATION RULES |
| Preview changes | Pattern 8: DRY RUN |
| Ensure reproducibility | Pattern 13: DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT |
| Debug failures | Pattern 12: ERROR SIGNALS |

### By Experience Level

**Beginners:**
1. Read THE SINGLE COMMAND
2. Read MANIFEST AS TRUTH
3. Try `ggen sync --dry-run`
4. Explore from there

**Intermediate:**
1. Study the Knowledge Patterns (4-7)
2. Understand the Safety Patterns (8-12)
3. Apply patterns to your projects

**Advanced:**
1. Study DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT deeply
2. Understand all pattern connections
3. Contribute new patterns

## The Confidence Stars

| Stars | Meaning | How to Use |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `*` | **Emerging** | Use with awareness that it may evolve |
| `**` | **Established** | Rely on it for production use |
| `***` | **Fundamental** | Essential—understand it deeply |

---

## When Patterns Conflict

Some patterns seem to pull in different directions:

- **FORCE OVERWRITE** says "write anyway"
- **DRY RUN** says "don't write at all"

These are not conflicts—they are **choices**. The patterns exist to give you options. Use `--force` when you need to override. Use `--dry-run` when you need to preview. The flags let you choose which pattern to apply.

## A Path Through the Language

For a first reading:

1. **THE SINGLE COMMAND** — The unified entry point
2. **MANIFEST AS TRUTH** — Configuration as declaration
3. **ONTOLOGY LOADING** — Bringing knowledge in
4. **GENERATION RULES** — Transforming knowledge to code
5. **DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT** — Reproducibility as foundation
6. **DRY RUN** — Safe exploration
7. **ERROR SIGNALS** — Understanding failures

This path takes you from "what is sync?" through "how does it work?" to "how do I use it safely?"

---

## The Living Language

This pattern language evolves with ggen sync. As new patterns emerge, they will be added. As patterns prove themselves, their confidence may increase.

The language lives in the practice of using it. When you use ggen sync, you speak this language.
