## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Component Design (Emerged from TDD)

```
PhaseExecutor (System Under Test)
      ↓ uses
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│             │              │             │
CommandExecutor  StateRepository  HookRegistry  Observer
(Interface)      (Interface)     (Interface)   (Interface)
      ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓
MockCommandExecutor MockStateRepository MockHookRegistry MockObserver
(Test Doubles)     (Test Doubles)    (Test Doubles)   (Test Doubles)
```

### Key Design Principles Applied

1. **Dependency Inversion**: PhaseExecutor depends on interfaces
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each mock has one clear purpose
3. **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused collaborator interfaces
4. **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend with new mock behaviors
5. **Liskov Substitution**: Mocks are perfect substitutes

### Design Patterns Used

- **Strategy Pattern**: Retry strategies, execution strategies
- **Command Pattern**: Phase execution encapsulation
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress notification
- **Repository Pattern**: State persistence abstraction
- **Builder Pattern**: Test data construction
- **Factory Pattern**: Test helpers and presets
