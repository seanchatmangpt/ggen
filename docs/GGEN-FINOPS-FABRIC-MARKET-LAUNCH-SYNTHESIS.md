## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (Non-Negotiable)

From enterprise adoption model + all agents' recommendations:

1. **Program Steward with Cross-Functional Authority**
   - One person (COO or CEO delegate) owns staffing, budget, prioritization
   - Reports to CEO; arbitrates between CTO, COO, CISO priorities
   - Authority to halt work if spec changes without approval

2. **Weekly Executive Steering Committee**
   - CEO, CFO, CTO, CISO, Compliance, COO, Talent, Counsel, Architect, CPO
   - 1-hour sync every Friday
   - Collision detection + decision arbitration

3. **Ops Team Co-Design from Day 1** (Gap 7: Incentive Cover)
   - Cannot be top-down mandate
   - Ops managers are architects (elevated, not eliminated)
   - Career ladder + compensation framework public Week 1
   - Role redesign = adoption enabler

4. **Specification Closure at Each Wave Gate**
   - No ambiguity on exit criteria
   - Explicit acceptance before proceeding
   - If gate blocked: 2-week remediation or pivot

5. **Deterministic Receipts** (Not Narratives)
   - Evidence replaces intuition
   - "[Receipt] Operations process: 80% faster execution, 80%+ adoption, zero attrition"
   - Dashboard of metrics visible to all executives

## GO / NO-GO DECISION FRAMEWORK

### PROCEED (All Agents Recommend) IF:

- [ ] Board approves $10M Series A funding
- [ ] Flagship customer COO + CFO sign implementation agreement (Week 1)
- [ ] Program Steward assigned (COO or CEO delegate)
- [ ] Weekly steering committee kickoff (all 10 executives commit)
- [ ] Legal engages on authority model (Week 1 priority)
- [ ] Product roadmap locked (no changes Week 1-8 without re-spec)

### PAUSE IF:

- [ ] Customer legal blocks authority model (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Funding delayed beyond Month 1
- [ ] Key executive (CTO, COO) unavailable
- [ ] Any gate blocked with no 2-week remediation path

### PIVOT IF:

- [ ] Customer adoption <50% by Week 5 (early warning)
- [ ] Sales cycle >8 months (market not ready)
- [ ] Customer NPS <5 consistently (product-market fit fail)

---

## FINANCIAL SNAPSHOT

**Year 1**: -$600k (burn), but on path to break-even Month 18
**Year 2**: +$12M cash flow (GAAP profitable)
**Year 3**: +$50M cash flow (ready for IPO)

**Unit Economics**:
- CAC: $150-300k
- LTV: $1.5-3M
- LTV/CAC: 5-20x (excellent)
- Payback period: 8-12 months

**Path to Profitability**:
- Month 18: Break-even (4-6 customers × $750k-$1M ACV each)
- Month 24: GAAP profitable ($15-25M ARR with 25%+ operating margin)

---

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### vs Terraform/Pulumi/CDK (Infrastructure-First Tools)
- **Strength**: Built for ops processes, not infrastructure
- **Defense**: Determinism proof (code-first tools can't offer this)
- **Message**: "Complement Terraform, don't replace it"
- **Win rate**: 80%+ vs infrastructure tools

### vs Runway/AWS Cost Management (Finance-First Tools)
- **Strength**: Ops-native automation + compliance
- **Defense**: Deterministic guarantees (probabilistic tools can't offer this)
- **Message**: "Finance can see costs via Runway; we automate processes to reduce costs"
- **Win rate**: 70%+ vs financial ops tools

### Unique Moats (10-year defensible advantage)
1. Determinism proof (A = μ(O)) — hard to copy
2. Folk-strategy ontology (67+ terms, queryable) — requires data
3. Authority model + cryptographic audit trail — built from Day 1
4. Sub-30 sec rollback — architectural advantage
5. Role preservation (architects, not eliminated) — adoption advantage

## INVESTOR NARRATIVE

### For VCs (Seed/Series A):

> "We're building the specification-driven code generation platform for enterprise operations. Our flagship customer is automating critical processes 80%+ faster. We have $50B TAM, proven unit economics (LTV/CAC 5-20x), and a defensible moat (determinism proof that competitors can't copy). $10M gets us to $50-100M ARR by Year 3. Path to IPO clear."

### For Corporates (CIO/COO Buyers):

> "Your operations run on tribal knowledge and manual checklists. We automate 80% of your ops time, with cryptographic proof every decision was right. Your team becomes architects instead of disappearing. Everyone wins: faster operations, lower costs, guaranteed compliance."

### For Customers (Pilot Buyers):

> "We reverse-engineer your operations into specs, then automate the decisions. 8 weeks, $100k, 25-50% cycle time reduction guaranteed, or we redo it free. You get: faster work, better decisions, audit trail for compliance, and your team promoted to architects."
