| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Customers Acquired** | 12-15 (net: 15-18 customers total) |
| **Pro Tier** | 10 customers × $70k/month × 12 = $8.4M |

## Unit Economics Detail

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Sales-Assisted Enterprise Model**:
```
Sales cycle length: 6 months
Sales team cost (fully loaded): $150k per AE × 2 AEs = $300k
Marketing support: $200k (content, events, ABM)
Total S&M for acquisition: $500k/year

Customers acquired per AE: 1-2 per year (long sales cycle)
Average CAC: $500k / 3 customers = ~$167k per customer

Faster sales cycles (via references): $100-150k CAC
Warm intros + existing relationships: $50-100k CAC
```

**Year 1 CAC**: $150-300k (high, because brand new + small volume)
**Year 2 CAC**: $100-150k (reference selling kicks in)
**Year 3 CAC**: $75-100k (brand awareness + product-led growth)

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**3-Year LTV Calculation** (Base Case: Pro Tier customer):
```
Initial Contract: $60k/month × 12 = $720k Year 1
Year 2 Expansion: +$10k/month (add 1 process) = $840k Year 2
Year 3 Expansion: +$10k/month (move to Enterprise) = $1.2M Year 3

Gross Margin: 75% (SaaS), 60% (blended with services ramp)
Cumulative GM: ($720k × 0.75) + ($840k × 0.7) + ($1.2M × 0.75) = $1.932M

3-Year LTV: $1.93M per customer
Less: CAC ($150k) + support costs ($50k) = Net LTV: $1.78M
```

**LTV/CAC Ratio**: $1.78M / $150k = **11.9x** (excellent)

### Unit Economics Comparison

| Metric | ggen-disney | SaaS Average | Top Quartile SaaS |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **CAC** | $150-300k | $200-400k | $100-150k |
| **LTV** | $1.5-3M | $1-2M | $3-5M |
| **LTV/CAC** | 5-20x | 3-5x | 8-15x |
| **Payback Period** | 8-12 months | 12-18 months | 6-9 months |
| **Magic Number** | 0.75-1.2 | 0.5-0.8 | 0.8-1.5 |

**Interpretation**: ggen-disney unit economics are **strong** (high CAC offset by high LTV, enterprise sticky).

## Pricing Sensitivity Analysis

### Price Elasticity (Pro Tier)

| Price | Customers | ARR | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|
| $40k/month | 35 customers | $16.8M | Too cheap; attracts low-value customers |
| **$60k/month** | **25 customers** | **$18M** | **BASE CASE** |
| $80k/month | 18 customers | $17.3M | Fewer customers; same ARR |
| $100k/month | 12 customers | $14.4M | Pricing out mid-market; risky |

**Recommendation**: Start at $60k (Pro), $150k (Enterprise) and adjust by vertical after 3 customers.

### Tier Mix Sensitivity (Year 2)

| Scenario | Pro Mix | Enterprise Mix | Total ARR |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Downside** | 80% (12 customers) | 20% (3 customers) | $12M |
| **Base Case** | 67% (10 customers) | 33% (5 customers) | $22M |
| **Upside** | 50% (7 customers) | 50% (7 customers) | $28M |

**Risk**: If we win only mid-market, ARR is $12M (below target).
**Mitigation**: Build 1 enterprise reference by Q4 2026; use for selling Year 2.

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Break-Even Point
```
Fixed Costs (Year 1): $4.6M operating + $400k overhead = $5M
Gross Margin per Customer (average): $1M/customer × 75% = $750k GM

Customers to Break-Even: $5M / $750k = 6.7 customers (~7)

Break-Even Timing:
  Q1 2026: Start with 0 customers
  Q2 2026: Add Disney (1 customer)
  Q3 2026: Add 2 early adopters (3 customers total)
  Q4 2026: Add 1-2 more (4-5 customers total)
  Q2 2027: Add 2-3 more → reach 7 customers (BREAK-EVEN)

Year 1 ends with 4 customers → still burning
Year 2 Q2 reaches break-even → positive cash flow from then on
```

### Sensitivity to Customer Acquisition

| Scenario | Q4 2026 Customers | Year 1 Burn | Year 2 Customers | Break-Even |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Slow** (2 customers) | 2 | -$3.5M | 6 | Q3 2027 |
| **Base** (4 customers) | 4 | -$600k | 15 | Q2 2027 |
| **Fast** (6 customers) | 6 | +$1M | 25 | Q1 2027 |

**Conclusion**: Even in slow scenario, positive cash flow by Q3 2027.

---

## Funding Requirements

### Series A (Recommend $10-15M)

**Use of Funds**:
- Product & R&D: $3M (build platform, maintain roadmap)
- Sales & Marketing: $4M (build sales team, marketing, early customer success)
- Operations & Admin: $1.5M (FTE ramp, infrastructure, insurance, legal)
- Contingency: $1.5-2M (buffer for opportunities, market changes)

**Why $10-15M?**:
- Runway: 18 months (reach profitability Month 18)
- Hiring capacity: 20 → 50 FTE over 18 months
- Customer acquisition: Runway for 6-12 customers before positive cash flow

**Ideal Timeline**: Raise $10M in Q2 2026, deploy through Q4 2027

## GTM Pricing Strategy (Launch)

### Day 1 Pricing (Pilot Phase)

**Landing Page Tiers**:
- Explorer (Free)
- Builder ($60k/month)
- Enterprise (Contact us)

**Messaging**: "Start free, grow with our pricing tiers."

**Discount Strategy** (Early customers):
- Disney: Flat fee $100k/year (strategic, not SaaS model)
- Early Adopter 1: 15% discount Year 1 ($51k/month) to secure reference
- Early Adopter 2: List price ($60k/month)
- Early Adopter 3: List price ($60k/month)

**Goal**: Establish $60k baseline quickly; don't race to bottom.

### Year 2 Pricing (Scale Phase)

**Adjust based on**:
- Customer feedback (pain points → pricing levers)
- Competitive positioning (Terraform, Pulumi pricing)
- Cost structure (hosting, support, personnel)

**Likely changes**:
- Pro tier: $60k → $75-80k (add more processes, advanced features)
- Enterprise: $150k → $200k (scale + complexity justify higher price)
- Add mid-market tier: $30-40k (if demand exists)

## Scenario Analysis (Upside / Downside)

### Downside Scenario (33rd Percentile)
```
Year 1: 2 customers (slower sales cycle)
  ARR: $1.2M (1 Pro @ $60k + 1 Ent @ $100k, partial year)
  Burn: -$3M

Year 2: 8 customers (reference selling kicks in)
  ARR: $9.6M
  EBITDA: +$2M (breakeven)

Year 3: 18 customers
  ARR: $25M
  EBITDA: +$15M

Year 5: $60M ARR (exit target for investors)
```

**Risk Factors**:
- Sales cycle longer than expected (8-9 months vs 6)
- Product-market fit slower (need 2-3 pivots)
- Competition (Terraform, Pulumi) accelerate enterprise offerings
- Churn higher (10% annually vs 5%)

### Base Scenario (50th Percentile) - Used Above
```
Year 1: 4 customers
Year 2: 15-18 customers
Year 3: 40-50 customers
Year 5: $200-300M ARR
```

### Upside Scenario (67th Percentile)
```
Year 1: 6 customers (especially Disney + 2 early adopters + 2 quick wins)
  ARR: $5.5M
  Burn: -$800k (positive by Q4)

Year 2: 25 customers (reference engine + analyst reports)
  ARR: $35M
  EBITDA: +$18M

Year 3: 60 customers
  ARR: $120M
  EBITDA: +$65M

Year 5: $500M+ ARR (IPO trajectory)
```

**Opportunity Factors**:
- Enterprise + compliance focus resonates (market timing)
- Folk Strategy / determinism buzz (developer + exec interest)
- API-first approach attracts ISV channel (partners embed)
- M&A interest from large platforms (acquirers seek compliance story)

| Q4 2027 | Sign 5-7 more customers | $15M+ ARR |
| Q1 2028 | Full year profitability | GAAP profitable |

**Total Path**:
- From funding to break-even: 12 months
- From funding to GAAP profitability: 18 months
- From funding to $100M ARR: 36 months

---

## Key Assumptions (Reality Check)

| Assumption | Value | Rationale | Risk |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Sales Cycle** | 6 months | Enterprise, complex buying | If 8 months: timeline slips |
| **CAC** | $150-250k | Sales + marketing + pilot costs | If higher: LTV/CAC erodes |
| **LTV** | $1.5-3M | 3-year, 70% retention | If churn 15%: LTV drops 40% |
| **Expansion** | 15-20% | Add processes, tier up | If 5%: ARR targets miss |
| **Win Rate** | 30% | Qualified pipeline → signed | If 15%: need 2x pipeline |
| **Team Size** | 50 FTE Year 3 | Scaled org | If 75 FTE: margins compress |

---

## Next Steps (Finance)

1. **Week 1**: Board approval of pricing + financial model
2. **Week 2**: Finance ops build (contracts, invoicing, ARR tracking)
3. **Week 3**: Sales comp design (tied to ARR, not just bookings)
4. **Month 4**: Finalize SLA + contract terms with legal
5. **Month 5**: Pricing live on website + sales playbook ready
6. **Ongoing**: Monthly P&L + cohort analysis (CAC, LTV tracking)

---

**Status**: FINANCIAL MODEL COMPLETE
**Review**: Board approval required before pricing go-live
**Next**: Quarterly model refinement as customers acquired
