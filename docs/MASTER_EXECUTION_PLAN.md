## 1. The ONE Thing That Matters Most

**THE CRITICAL BOTTLENECK:**
> Users can't experience ggen's value in their first 5 minutes.

**Current Reality:**
- 15-25 minute time-to-first-success
- Complex installation (Rust prerequisite unclear)
- No clear "golden path" workflow
- 60% abandonment rate
- No instant gratification

**THE SOLUTION:**
> **"Magic Quickstart"** - Single command that delivers working code in <3 minutes

**Why This Matters:**
- **80% of user acquisition** depends on first impression
- **First 5 minutes** determines if users stay or leave
- **Viral growth** requires instant "wow" moment
- **All other efforts fail** if users don't get past onboarding

**Success Metric:**
- Onboarding time: 25 min → <3 min (88% reduction)
- Abandonment rate: 60% → <15% (75% improvement)
- Activation rate: 40% → 85% (112% increase)

---

#### Risk 5: Funding Shortfall 💰

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Critical (runway)

**Mitigation:**
- **Lean Operations:** Keep burn rate <$60K/month
- **Revenue Focus:** Launch Pro tier by Month 6
- **Fundraising Prep:** Build pitch deck early (Month 3)
- **Contingency:** Cut non-essential costs (ads, conferences)
