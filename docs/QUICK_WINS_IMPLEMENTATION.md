## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues

1. **quickstart.sh May Need Testing**:
   - **Risk**: Script may fail on some platforms/configurations
   - **Mitigation**: Test on clean VMs (macOS, Ubuntu, Fedora)
   - **Fallback**: Provide manual installation instructions

2. **`ggen doctor` Requires Compile**:
   - **Risk**: New command may have build errors
   - **Mitigation**: Run `cargo build` to validate
   - **Fallback**: Fix compilation errors before merge

3. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - **Risk**: `colored` crate may not be in dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Add to Cargo.toml if needed
   - **Impact**: Low (simple dependency)

### Testing Checklist (Pre-Merge)

- [ ] Run `cargo build` to verify doctor command compiles
- [ ] Run `cargo test` to ensure no broken tests
- [ ] Run `cargo make ci` for full validation
- [ ] Test quickstart.sh on clean Ubuntu VM
- [ ] Test quickstart.sh on macOS
- [ ] Verify README rendering on GitHub
- [ ] Check CONTRIBUTING.md links work
