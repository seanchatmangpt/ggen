# Dogfooding Ggen: Using Ggen to Build Ggen

> "Eating our own dog food" - Using ggen's toolchain to develop, maintain, and improve ggen itself.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**If ggen can build itself, it proves the toolchain works.**

Dogfooding creates a self-improving development loop where improvements to ggen make developing ggen easier.

## 📋 Quick Reference

| Phase | Status | Priority | Document |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| [Phase 1: Basic Dogfooding](#phase-1-basic-dogfooding) | ✅ In Progress | **High** | [01-basic-dogfooding.md](01-basic-dogfooding.md) |
| [Phase 2: Advanced Dogfooding](#phase-2-advanced-dogfooding) | 🔄 Planning | **Medium** | [02-advanced-dogfooding.md](02-advanced-dogfooding.md) |
| [Phase 3: Complete Dogfooding](#phase-3-complete-dogfooding) | 📋 Future | **Low** | [03-complete-dogfooding.md](03-complete-dogfooding.md) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Current State (What We're Moving Away From)
```bash
❌ cargo build --release
❌ cargo test
❌ cargo clippy
❌ Manual file creation for new commands
❌ Direct cargo dependency management
```

### Target State (Dogfooding Approach)
```bash
✅ ggen lifecycle run build
✅ ggen lifecycle run test
✅ ggen lifecycle run lint
✅ ggen template generate templates/cli-command.tmpl
✅ ggen market add "rust-error-handling"
```

## 🎯 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Dogfooding (Current) ✅

**Priority**: **High** | **Timeline**: Weeks 1-4 | **Complexity**: Low

Focus on immediate, high-value dogfooding that requires minimal infrastructure:

- ✅ Use lifecycle for build/test operations
- ✅ Generate examples with templates
- 🔄 Self-host marketplace packages
- 🔄 CI/CD integration with lifecycle

**See**: [01-basic-dogfooding.md](01-basic-dogfooding.md)

### Phase 2: Advanced Dogfooding (Planning) 🔄

**Priority**: **Medium** | **Timeline**: Weeks 5-12 | **Complexity**: Medium

Intermediate dogfooding requiring moderate infrastructure:

- Model ggen CLI in RDF ontology
- Generate CLI commands from templates
- Use AI for documentation generation
- Template-driven feature development

**See**: [02-advanced-dogfooding.md](02-advanced-dogfooding.md)

### Phase 3: Complete Dogfooding (Future) 📋

**Priority**: **Low** | **Timeline**: Months 4-6 | **Complexity**: High

Advanced dogfooding creating self-improving loops:

- All new features generated from templates
- Complete codebase modeled in RDF
- AI-assisted code review and optimization
- Self-evolving marketplace

**See**: [03-complete-dogfooding.md](03-complete-dogfooding.md)

## 🎯 80/20 Rule Applied

Focus on the 20% of dogfooding activities that provide 80% of the value:

### High-Value Activities (Do First) ⚡
1. **Lifecycle Integration** - Replace all cargo commands with `ggen lifecycle`
2. **Marketplace Self-Hosting** - Publish ggen patterns as marketplace packages
3. **Template Generation** - Generate repetitive code (CLI commands, tests, docs)
4. **CI/CD Integration** - Use lifecycle in GitHub Actions

### Medium-Value Activities (Do Second) 📊
5. **RDF Modeling** - Model CLI structure for queries
6. **AI Documentation** - Generate docs with `ggen ai generate`
7. **Template-Driven Features** - Use templates for new features

### Lower-Value Activities (Do Later) 🔮
8. **Complete RDF Codebase** - Full codebase representation in RDF
9. **AI Code Review** - Automated optimization suggestions
10. **Self-Evolving Marketplace** - Automated pattern discovery

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Create lifecycle phases for ggen development
- [ ] Replace CI/CD cargo commands with ggen lifecycle
- [ ] Document current build process as lifecycle phases
- [ ] Create basic CLI command template

### Week 3-4: Marketplace Self-Hosting
- [ ] Create "ggen-cli-command-pattern" package
- [ ] Create "ggen-lifecycle-phase" package
- [ ] Create "ggen-marketplace-package" package
- [ ] Publish to marketplace

### Week 5-8: Template-Driven Development
- [ ] Generate new CLI commands from templates
- [ ] Generate test suites from templates
- [ ] Generate documentation from templates
- [ ] Create feature development template

### Week 9-12: Advanced Integration
- [ ] Model CLI structure in RDF
- [ ] Implement SPARQL queries for code analysis
- [ ] Create AI-assisted documentation generation
- [ ] Implement template validation workflow

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Dogfooding Environment

```bash
# Ensure ggen is installed
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .

# Verify installation
ggen --version
ggen lifecycle list
ggen market list
```

### 2. Start with Basic Dogfooding

Follow [Phase 1: Basic Dogfooding](01-basic-dogfooding.md) to begin:

```bash
# Create lifecycle configuration
cd /path/to/ggen
ggen lifecycle run init

# Test lifecycle integration
ggen lifecycle run build
ggen lifecycle run test
```

### 3. Progress Through Phases

Work through each phase sequentially:
1. **Phase 1**: Establish foundation with lifecycle and marketplace
2. **Phase 2**: Add template generation and AI assistance
3. **Phase 3**: Create self-improving development loop
