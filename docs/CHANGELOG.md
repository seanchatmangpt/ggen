## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **GenAI Integration Examples**: Three new working examples demonstrating genai v0.4 integration with qwen3-coder:30b model:
  - `genai_ollama_loop.rs` - Interactive conversation loop with conversation history management
  - `genai_ollama_stream.rs` - Real-time streaming responses for better UX
  - `genai_ollama_multi_provider_compare.rs` - Multi-provider comparison tool for benchmarking different models

### Fixed
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved multiple compilation and runtime issues across AI integration
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports, standardized client creation patterns, and cleaned up generated comments
- **Configuration Issues**: Fixed hardcoded Ollama defaults and improved provider-agnostic configuration
- **Build Performance**: Implemented incremental compilation, parallel builds, and optimized Cargo profiles for 96% faster builds (60s â†’ 2s)
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Eliminated duplicate dependencies (base64 v0.21.7 vs v0.22.1, reqwest v0.11 vs v0.12)
- **Version Consistency**: Updated all version references to v1.0.0 across documentation

### Changed
- **AI Command Structure**: Reformatted and cleaned up AI-related CLI commands for better maintainability
- **Provider Abstraction**: Improved multi-provider support with better abstraction patterns and reduced hardcoded preferences

### Technical Details
- **GenAI v0.4 Integration**: Successfully integrated rust-genai library v0.4 with comprehensive examples and documentation
- **Build Optimizations**: Reduced incremental build times from 60-90 seconds to 2-3 seconds using incremental compilation and parallel builds
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Enhanced provider abstraction while removing hardcoded Ollama preferences for true provider agnosticism
