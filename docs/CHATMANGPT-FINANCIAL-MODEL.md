## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Model

### Direct Sales (40% of new business)

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Sales Headcount** | $150k/person/year | 2 AEs, 1 SDR, 1 Sales Ops = $450k/year |
| **Proof-of-Concept** | $25k per deal | 2-3 week ontology design + demo MCP server |
| **Marketing** | $100k/year | Content, events, analyst relations |
| **Sales Ops/Tools** | $50k/year | CRM, proposal software, etc. |
| **Total Sales Spend** | $600k/year | |
| **Deals Closed** | 8-10/year | Conservative estimate |
| **CAC (Direct)** | **$60-75k** | Per-deal cost to close |

### Partner/Integrator Channel (30% of new business)

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Partner Manager** | $150k/year | 1 FTE to manage 5-10 resellers |
| **Partner Training** | $50k/year | Onboarding, cert, support |
| **Co-Marketing** | $50k/year | Joint GTM |
| **Total Partner Spend** | $250k/year | |
| **Deals via Partners** | 6-8/year | 60-70% attach rate on partner customers |
| **CAC (Partner)** | **$30-40k** | Much lower (partner bears sales cost) |

### Freemium/PLG (20% of new business)

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Product** | (included in engineering) | Self-service onboarding |
| **Marketing** | $30k/year | Content, SEO, community |
| **Support (L1)** | $50k/year | Community + email support |
| **Total Freemium Spend** | $80k/year | |
| **Conversions** | 12-15/year | 5-8% conversion rate from free to paid |
| **CAC (Freemium)** | **$5-7k** | Highest LTV, lowest CAC |

### Blended CAC
```
CAC = (Direct CAC × 0.4) + (Partner CAC × 0.3) + (Freemium CAC × 0.2)
CAC = ($67.5k × 0.4) + ($35k × 0.3) + ($6k × 0.2)
CAC = $27k + $10.5k + $1.2k
CAC = ~$39k (blended average)
```

## Revenue Expansion Per Customer

### Year 1 (Ontology License + Light Execution)

| Product | Price | Attach | Amount |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Ontology License** (annual) | $100k | 100% | $100k |
| **Setup/Onboarding** | $25k | 100% | $25k |
| **Execution SaaS** (if used) | $0.10 per proposal | 30% | $15k |
| **TOTAL ACV Year 1** | | | **$140k** |

### Year 2 (Expansion + New Ontologies)

| Product | Price | Attach | Amount |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Ontology 1 Renewal** | $100k | 95% | $95k |
| **Ontology 2 (New Domain)** | $100k | 40% | $40k |
| **Execution SaaS Growth** | Variable | 50% | $30k |
| **Receipt Registry** (Compliance Module) | $50k | 30% | $15k |
| **TOTAL ACV Year 2** | | | **$180k** |

### Year 3 (Platform Stickiness)

| Product | Price | Attach | Amount |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Ontology 1 Renewal** | $100k | 95% | $95k |
| **Ontology 2 Renewal** | $100k | 95% | $95k |
| **Ontology 3 (New Domain)** | $100k | 50% | $50k |
| **Execution SaaS Growth** | Variable | 60% | $50k |
| **Receipt Registry** | $50k | 50% | $25k |
| **Premium Support/SLA** | $30k | 30% | $9k |
| **TOTAL ACV Year 3** | | | **$324k** |

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

```
Assumptions:
- Initial ACV: $140k
- Year 2 ACV: $180k (+28%)
- Year 3 ACV: $324k (+80%)
- Retention Rate: 90% (annual)
- Average Lifetime: 5 years

LTV = Sum of annual revenue over 5 years

Year 1: $140k
Year 2: $180k × 0.90 = $162k
Year 3: $324k × 0.90^2 = $262k
Year 4: $400k × 0.90^3 = $292k (estimated growth)
Year 5: $500k × 0.90^4 = $329k (estimated growth)

LTV = $140k + $162k + $262k + $292k + $329k = $1.185M

LTV/CAC = $1.185M / $39k = 30x (excellent)
Payback Period = CAC / (ACV/12) = $39k / $11.7k = 3.3 months (fast)
```

**Year 5 Exit** (Conservative)

| Multiple | ARR | Valuation |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| **4x ARR** | $33.5M | $134M |
| **6x ARR** | $33.5M | $201M |
| **8x ARR** | $33.5M | $268M |

**Founder Return** (with 80% ownership post-Series A):
- 4x ARR: $107M (~2.7x cash return on $10M investment)
- 6x ARR: $161M (~4x cash return)
- 8x ARR: $214M (~5.4x cash return)

**IPO Scenario** (Year 5-6)

If we reach $50M ARR by Year 6:
- IPO at 8-10x revenue multiple: $400-500M valuation
- Founder ownership: ~60% (after subsequent dilution rounds)
- IPO proceeds: $100-150M (20-30% offering)

## Break-Even & Profitability Timeline

**Burn and Runway**

```
Year 1:
  Revenue: $2.1M
  OpEx: $2.3M
  EBITDA: -$500k
  Runway at burn rate: ~16 months (assuming $10M Series A funding)

Year 2:
  Revenue: $6.3M

  EBITDA: +$1.2M (BREAKEVEN!)
  Monthly burn: Turns positive ($100k/month)

Year 3:
  Revenue: $14.5M
  OpEx: $6.4M
  EBITDA: +$6.6M
  Operating margin: 45%
```

**Critical Milestone**: Achieve positive unit economics by Month 18

---

## Key Financial Drivers

### 1. Customer Acquisition Efficiency
- Target CAC payback < 6 months
- Actual CAC payback at blended $39k / ($140k/12) = **3.3 months** ✓

### 2. Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Year 1→2 expansion: $140k → $165k = **118% NRR**
- Year 2→3 expansion: $165k → $220k = **133% NRR**
- Strong land-and-expand model

### 3. Rule of 40 (Growth + Margin)
- Year 2: 200% growth + 19% margin = 219 (excellent)
- Year 3: 130% growth + 45% margin = 175 (excellent)
- Year 4: 69% growth + 56% margin = 125 (good)
- Consistently beats rule of 40

### 4. Cash Conversion
- Target: >100% (FCF > EBITDA)
- Actual Year 2: FCF $1.35M / EBITDA $1.2M = **113%** ✓
- Strong cash position enables reinvestment

## Risk Scenarios

### Downside Case (50% achievement)

| Metric | Base Case | Downside | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Year 3 ARR** | $14.5M | $7.2M | -50% |
| **Year 3 Customers** | 70 | 35 | -50% |
| **Year 3 EBITDA** | +$6.6M | +$2.2M | -67% |
| **Break-even** | Month 18 | Month 24 | +6 months |
| **Series B Funding Needed** | $0 (positive cash) | $5M | Extra round |

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Expand to SMB segment (freemium PLG)
- Partner with integrators (faster customer acquisition)
- Vertical specialization (healthcare, financial services)
- Receipt registry monetization (compliance-as-code)

### Upside Case (150% achievement)

| Metric | Base Case | Upside | Change |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Year 3 ARR** | $14.5M | $21.8M | +50% |
| **Year 3 Customers** | 70 | 105 | +50% |
| **Year 3 EBITDA** | +$6.6M | +$10M | +51% |
| **Break-even** | Month 18 | Month 12 | -6 months |
| **Series C Opportunity** | Not needed | $50M+ valuation | IPO-track |

**Expansion Opportunities**:
- Enter horizontal integrator space (enterprise-wide, not vertical)
- Build managed executor SaaS (recurring revenue)
- Integrator partner program (white-label ggen)
- Receipt registry + compliance industry (insurance model)

---

## The Financial Thesis

**ChatmanGPT wins on every financial metric vs traditional integrators:**

1. **Unit economics are 10x better**
   - Cost per integration: $30k vs $660k
   - Margin per integration: 85% vs 33%

2. **Scalability is exponential**
   - Integrators scale with people (linear)
   - We scale with ontologies (exponential, reusable)

3. **Customer lifetime value is higher**
   - LTV: $1.18M vs integrator's $500k
   - LTV/CAC: 30x (industry-leading)
   - Payback: 3.3 months (fastest in category)

4. **Path to profitability is clear**
   - Break-even in Year 2 (Month 18)
   - 45% operating margin by Year 3
   - Path to $50M+ ARR by Year 5

5. **The market is enormous and fragmented**
   - $50B+ integrator market
   - No category leader (consolidation opportunity)
   - 10,000+ enterprises with 20+ person integration teams

**Bottom Line**: At $40M Series A valuation, buying ChatmanGPT at 2-3x revenue is a bargain. By Year 5, this is a $400-500M company. By Year 7, this is a $1B+ company (if we expand beyond initial vertical).
