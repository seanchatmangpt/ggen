# GGen Cookbook: A Pattern Language for Autonomic Code Generation (2nd Edition)

**The complete guide to eliminating software's "dark matter" using knowledge-first development and the 80/20 principle.**

This cookbook shows how GGen **inverts the 80/20 equation**:
- **Traditional development**: 80% dark matter, 20% value creation
- **GGen development**: 20% dark matter, 80% value creation

This is the source for the GGen Cookbook 2nd Edition, built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

## ðŸ”¥ New in This Edition: The Dark Matter Cookbook

- **[DARK_MATTER_COOKBOOK.md](DARK_MATTER_COOKBOOK.md)** - Complete 80/20 transformation guide
- **Dark Matter Solutions** - Specific patterns for eliminating each category of dark matter
- **Implementation Roadmap** - Step-by-step transformation from traditional to knowledge-first development
- **Quantitative Metrics** - Measure your dark matter elimination success
