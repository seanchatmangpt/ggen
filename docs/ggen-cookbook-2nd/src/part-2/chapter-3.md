# Chapter 3: The GGen Engine

## Overview

This chapter explores the technical foundation of GGen: the engine that powers code generation. We'll examine the architecture, processing pipeline, registry system, and extension points that make GGen a powerful and flexible code generation platform.

## What You'll Learn

- How GGen's architecture supports autonomic code generation
- The template processing pipeline from input to output
- How the registry system manages templates and dependencies
- Extension points for customizing and extending GGen

## Chapter Structure

- [3.1 Architecture Overview](./chapter-3-1.md) - High-level system design
- [3.2 Template Processing Pipeline](./chapter-3-2.md) - How templates are processed
- [3.3 The Registry System](./chapter-3-3.md) - Template discovery and management
- [3.4 Extension Points](./chapter-3-4.md) - Customizing and extending GGen

## Key Concepts

### **Autonomic Engine**
GGen's engine exhibits self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing properties, reducing the need for manual intervention.

### **Template Processing Pipeline**
The sequence of steps that transform templates and data into generated code, including validation, rendering, and post-processing.

### **Registry System**
A distributed system for discovering, installing, and managing templates and their dependencies.

### **Extension Points**
Well-defined interfaces for customizing GGen's behavior and adding new capabilities.

## Architecture Principles

GGen's architecture follows several key principles:

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities without modifying core code
3. **Determinism**: Reproducible outputs from the same inputs
4. **Performance**: Optimized for speed and memory efficiency
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## The Generate-Validate-Refine Loop

At the heart of GGen is the autonomic loop:

```
┌─────────────┐
│  GENERATE   │  Apply template with input data
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  VALIDATE   │  Check outputs against rules
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   REFINE    │  Adjust template or input
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       └──────────┐
                  │
           (iterate until satisfied)
```

This loop embodies autonomic behavior:
- **Self-configuration**: Templates auto-detect context and apply intelligent defaults
- **Self-optimization**: The system learns which templates work best for which scenarios
- **Self-healing**: Validation catches errors early; recovery strategies adapt templates
- **Self-protection**: Deterministic generation ensures reproducibility

## Core Components

### **Template Engine**
Processes templates using Handlebars syntax with custom helpers and extensions.

### **Graph Store**
Manages RDF knowledge graphs that serve as the semantic foundation for generation.

### **Query Engine**
Executes SPARQL queries against knowledge graphs to extract projection data.

### **Validation System**
Ensures generated code meets quality criteria through syntax checking, linting, and testing.

### **Registry Client**
Discovers, installs, and manages templates from local and remote registries.

## Performance Characteristics

GGen is designed for high performance:

- **First build**: ≤ 15 seconds for typical projects
- **Incremental builds**: ≤ 2 seconds for changed templates
- **RDF processing**: ≤ 5 seconds for 1k+ triples
- **Memory usage**: ≤ 100MB for typical generation tasks
- **CLI responsiveness**: ≤ 3 seconds end-to-end for most commands

## Next Steps

Start with [3.1: Architecture Overview](./chapter-3-1.md) to understand the high-level system design, then explore the detailed components and processes.
