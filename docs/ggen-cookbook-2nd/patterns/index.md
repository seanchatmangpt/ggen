# GGen Pattern Language Index

This index provides a comprehensive overview of all patterns in the GGen pattern language, organized by category and use case.

## Foundation Patterns

These patterns establish the fundamental approach to code generation in GGen.

### **Pattern 001: KNOWLEDGE-FIRST PROJECTION** ⭐⭐⭐
**Context**: You need to generate code from domain models, but templates could accept arbitrary data structures.

**Problem**: How do you ensure generated code is consistent, traceable, and semantically grounded?

**Solution**: Establish the knowledge graph as the single source of truth. Before any template execution, load semantic data into an RDF graph, query it using SPARQL, and project results into template-friendly structures.

**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Semantic consistency across all generated artifacts
- ✅ Traceability from generated code back to domain concepts
- ✅ Multi-language generation from the same semantic source
- ❌ Requires investment in knowledge graph creation and maintenance
- ❌ Adds complexity to the generation pipeline

### **Pattern 002: DETERMINISTIC ENGINE** ⭐⭐⭐
**Context**: Building on Pattern 001, we have semantic graphs as our source of truth. However, code generators often produce different outputs from the same inputs due to timestamp injection, random IDs, or environmental dependencies.

**Problem**: How do you guarantee that the same semantic graph and template will always produce exactly the same generated code, regardless of when or where generation occurs?

**Solution**: Eliminate all sources of non-determinism from the generation pipeline. Enforce fixed seeds, no system time, ordered iteration, no environment leaks, content-addressed IDs, and hermetic execution.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reproducible builds (same input graph = same output)
- ✅ Content-addressable caching (hash outputs to detect changes)
- ✅ Snapshot testing (generated code can be committed and diffed)
- ✅ Time-travel debugging (reproduce any historical generation exactly)
- ❌ No timestamps or random values in generated code
- ❌ Requires careful template design

### **Pattern 003: GRAPH-TEMPLATE BINDING** ⭐⭐⭐
**Context**: Building on Pattern 001, we have semantic graphs as our source of truth. However, templates need a way to declare their data dependencies and specify exactly what information they require from the knowledge graph.

**Problem**: How do you ensure templates receive exactly the data they need from knowledge graphs, while maintaining clear traceability and enabling template reuse across different domains?

**Solution**: Bind templates to knowledge graphs through explicit SPARQL queries in template frontmatter. Every template declares its data needs via a `query` field.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Explicit dependencies (templates clearly declare what data they need)
- ✅ Precise extraction (SPARQL queries extract exactly the required information)
- ✅ Template validation (missing data is caught before template execution)
- ✅ Domain reusability (same template works across different knowledge graphs)
- ❌ Requires SPARQL knowledge for template authors
- ❌ Adds complexity to template frontmatter

### **Pattern 004: NOUN-VERB CLI** ⭐⭐
**Context**: Building on Pattern 001 and Pattern 003, we have semantic graphs as the source of truth and templates that explicitly declare their data needs. However, users need an intuitive way to interact with these semantic concepts through the command line.

**Problem**: How do you design a command-line interface that naturally maps to semantic operations on knowledge graphs while remaining intuitive for users?

**Solution**: Use a noun-verb command structure that directly maps to semantic concepts and operations. The CLI follows the pattern: `ggen <noun> <verb> [options]`

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Semantic clarity (commands directly reflect semantic concepts)
- ✅ Intuitive discovery (users can explore available operations naturally)
- ✅ Consistent patterns (same verb means the same thing across different nouns)
- ✅ Easy extension (new concepts and operations follow established patterns)
- ❌ Requires learning the noun-verb structure
- ❌ May not fit all use cases

**Problem**: How do you generate consistent, high-quality code for multiple languages while maintaining semantic coherence and avoiding duplication?

**Solution**: Use the same SPARQL query across multiple language-specific templates. Each template handles the language-specific rendering while sharing the same semantic foundation.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Semantic consistency across all generated languages
- ✅ Single source of truth for domain logic
- ✅ Easy to add new languages
- ✅ Maintains language-specific best practices
- ❌ Requires separate templates for each language
- ❌ May not capture all language-specific nuances

### **Pattern 006: LOCKFILE VERSIONING** ⭐⭐
**Context**: You're generating code that depends on external libraries and want to ensure reproducible builds and dependency management.

**Problem**: How do you manage dependencies in generated code to ensure reproducible builds and easy updates?

**Solution**: Generate lockfiles that pin exact versions of all dependencies. Use content hashes to detect changes and enable incremental updates.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reproducible builds (exact dependency versions)
- ✅ Change detection (content hashes identify updates)
- ✅ Incremental updates (only update what changed)
- ✅ Security (pin known-good versions)
- ❌ Requires lockfile maintenance
- ❌ May prevent automatic security updates
