## Quarterly OKR Review Process

### OKR Cadence

**Month 1** (Q+1 Planning):
- Retrospective: Q score (30 min, all-hands)
- Planning: Q+1 OKRs drafted (48 hours, leadership)
- Alignment: OKR sync across teams (2 hours, each team)

**Months 2-3** (Execution):
- Weekly check-ins: Progress update (5 min per team)
- Monthly review: KPIs vs targets (30 min leadership)

**Month 4** (Wrap-up):
- Final review: Q outcomes scored (60 min)
- Retrospective: What worked? What didn't? (90 min)
- Next planning: Q+1 OKRs finalized

### OKR Scoring

**Key Result Grading**:
- 1.0 = 100% (goal achieved)
- 0.7 = 70% (goal mostly achieved)
- 0.5 = 50% (goal partially achieved)
- 0.0 = 0% (goal not achieved)

**Target Score**: 0.7 per KR (ambitious but achievable)

**Aggregate Score**:
- 0.8-1.0 = Excellent (team exceeded expectations)
- 0.6-0.8 = Good (team met expectations)
- 0.4-0.6 = Fair (team missed some targets)
- <0.4 = Poor (significant miss)

### Transparency & Communication

**Public OKR Dashboard**:

- Monthly all-hands review (transparent scoring)
- Quarterly retrospective (lessons learned shared)

**Rationale**:
- Transparency prevents silos
- Shared goals build alignment
- Honest scoring enables learning

```
Q1: Disney pilots + 1 early adopter (2 customers)
Q2-Q3: 2-3 additional customers (4-5 total)
Q4: 5-6 customers, $2-3M ARR (below target, but viable)

Q1: Disney pilots + 2 early adopters
Q2: 1-2 new customers (4-5 total)
Q3: 2-3 new customers (6-8 total)
Q4: 4-6 customers, $3-5M ARR (target achieved)

Drivers: On-time execution, market responsiveness
```

### Scenario C: Upside (67th Percentile)
```
Q1: Disney + 3 early adopters (4 customers)
Q2: 2-3 customers (6-7 total)
Q3: 3-4 customers (9-11 total)
Q4: 6-10 customers, $5-8M ARR (above target, breakout)

Drivers: Product excellence, reference engine, freemium virality
```

## Exit Criteria (When to Pivot or Stop)

### RED FLAGS (Immediate Action Required)

- [ ] Disney exit gate fails (Week 8, no path forward in 2 weeks)

### YELLOW FLAGS (Strategic Review Required)

- [ ] Burn rate >$400k/month sustained (funding insufficient)
- [ ] Team retention <90% (cultural issues emerging)
- [ ] Analyst reports position competitors as superior (reposition or pivot)

### GREEN LIGHTS (Continue Aggressive Growth)

3. **Week 3**: Align team OKRs (cross-functional dependencies)
4. **Month 1**: Kick off KPI dashboard (real-time tracking)
5. **Monthly**: Review progress (all-hands scorecard)
6. **Quarterly**: OKR retrospective + Q+1 planning

---

**Status**: OKRs & SUCCESS CRITERIA COMPLETE
**Approval**: Ready for board approval
**Next Review**: Weekly (Monday morning KPI check), Monthly (deep-dive)
