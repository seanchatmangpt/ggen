## Phase 1: Opportunity Capture (Days 0–2)

### Objective
Identify high-fit government sales opportunities and conduct initial viability assessment.

### Activities

#### 1.1 Opportunity Identification
- **Sources**: Sam.gov (Federal Procurements), GSA Schedule review, Contracting Officer outreach, incumbent lists, Partner intelligence
- **Filters**:
  - Minimum deal size: $250K
  - Maximum timeline: 90 days to RFP
  - Customer type: Federal, State/Local, Defense, Intelligence Community, or GSA Cooperative
- **Red Flags**: No budget identified, >180 days to RFP, customer has existing long-term incumbent

#### 1.2 Customer Profile (Use Template: Customer Summary)
```
Organization: [Name]
Customer Type: Federal / State / Defense / IC
Agency: [e.g., HHS, DoD, USAF]
Buying Center: [e.g., Chief Information Security Officer, Compliance Officer, Program Manager]
Budget Owner: [Name, phone, email]
Current Spend on Similar Solutions: $[X]M/year
Decision Timeline: [Q3 2026, RFP expected [DATE]]
Incumbent Solution: [Current system, satisfaction level]
Buying Authority: [Determines approval limits]
```

#### 1.3 Pain Point Discovery (Initial Conversation)
- **Script Question**: "What's your top compliance/security challenge right now?"
- **Capture**: 3–5 pain points using template (see below)
- **Goal**: Map pain points to ggen SKUs

**Example Pain Point Doc**:
```
Customer: HHS Office of [X]
Pain Point 1: FedRAMP compliance takes 9 months, we're on month 7
  - Gap: Need faster, deterministic assessment framework
  - ggen SKU Fit: Compliance Monitor, FedRAMP Assessment Engine
  - Urgency: CRITICAL (deadline in 3 months)

Pain Point 2: NIST 800-53 controls scattered across 5 different tools
  - Gap: No unified control mapping, no audit trail
  - ggen SKU Fit: Control Mapper, Evidence Aggregator
  - Urgency: HIGH (audit in 6 months)
```

### Deliverables (Day 2)
- ✅ Customer Summary document (1 page)
- ✅ Pain Points analysis (3–5 points mapped to SKUs)
- ✅ Go/No-Go decision: **Proceed to Qualification** or **Archive**
- ✅ Primary contact (name, phone, email) added to CRM

---

## Phase 2: Qualification (Days 2–5)

### Objective
Validate budget, timeline, decision authority, and strategic fit. **Go/No-Go gate**: Does this opportunity meet our criteria?

### 2.1 Budget Qualification
- **Question**: "What's the approved budget for this initiative?"
- **Accept**: Budget identified and ≥$250K
- **Defer**: Budget TBD (track, revisit in 30 days)
- **Decline**: <$250K or budget completely open with no timeline

### 2.2 Timeline Validation
- **Question**: "When do you plan to issue the RFP? When must the contract be awarded?"
- **Accept**: RFP in 30–90 days, allows us 30-day response time
- **Defer**: >90 days (low urgency, track for future)
- **Decline**: <30 days (unrealistic for quality response)

### 2.3 Decision Authority Check
- **Question**: "Who will make the final decision? Are there other vendors being considered?"
- **Capture**:
  - Decision maker (title, name, contact info)
  - Procurement method (sole-source, competitive, GSA schedule)
  - Number of competitors (if known)
  - Historical win rate for this customer (if repeat buyer)

### 2.4 Compliance Requirements (Initial)
- **Question**: "What compliance frameworks must your solution meet?"
- **Frameworks to Ask About**:
  - FISMA / FedRAMP / Impact Level
  - HIPAA / HITECH (if HHS)
  - DFARS / ITAR (if Defense)
  - SOC 2 Type II
  - NIST 800-53 specific controls
  - Any custom compliance requirements

### Qualification Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Accept | Defer | Decline |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Budget | ≥$250K identified | TBD, revisit | <$250K or unknown |
| Timeline | 30–90 days to RFP | >90 days | <30 days |
| Decision Authority | Clear, identified | Unclear | Political/indefinite |
| Strategic Fit | Aligns with 3+ SKUs | 1–2 SKUs | 0 SKUs / custom only |
| Current Spend | High (can expand) | Moderate | Minimal (price sensitive) |

**Decision**: ✅ **ACCEPT** = Proceed to Discovery | ⏸️ **DEFER** = Track, revisit | ❌ **DECLINE** = Archive

### Deliverables (Day 5)
- ✅ Qualification scorecard (completed matrix)
- ✅ Updated customer profile (budget, timeline, decision authority)
- ✅ Compliance framework list (initial)
- ✅ Go/No-Go decision: **Proceed to Discovery** or **Defer/Archive**

---

## Phase 3: Discovery & Sales Engineering (Days 5–15)

### Objective
Conduct deep-dive technical conversations to map customer compliance gaps to ggen SKUs. Generate auditor-ready evidence that proves fit.

### 3.1 Discovery Conversation Blueprint

**Conversation 1: Compliance Requirements Deep-Dive (2 hours)**
- Walk through compliance matrix (see compliance-matrix.md)
- Identify which specific NIST controls are critical
- Understand evidence requirements (documentation, testing, audits)
- Identify gaps in current tooling
- Timeline for compliance certification

**Conversation 2: Technical Architecture (1.5 hours)**
- Current systems and integrations
- Data flow and sensitivity
- Infrastructure (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
- Team structure (security, DevOps, database)
- Existing monitoring/logging tooling

**Conversation 3: Procurement & Decision Criteria (1.5 hours)**
- Procurement method and authority
- Evaluation criteria (technical, pricing, past performance)
- Reference check expectations
- Insurance/bonding requirements
- Timeline for contract award

### 3.2 SKU Fit Analysis (Template: SKU Fit)

For each SKU identified during discovery:

```
SKU: Compliance Monitor (15-person, 1-year license)
Customer Fit Score: 8.5/10

Why Fit:
  - Covers 8 of 12 required NIST 800-53 controls
  - Evidence: Real-time control monitoring, automated reports
  - Price point: $180K/year (fits $500K budget)
  - Deployment: 8 weeks (fits 12-week RFP timeline)

Gaps/Risks:
  - Doesn't handle IR-2 (Incident Response) - need separate tool
  - Requires 2 FTEs for integration (include in SOW)

Recommendation: Bundle with Incident Response Engine (SKU-08)
Bundle Price: $280K/year (vs. $240K standalone, but covers all controls)
```

### 3.3 Competitive Landscape Analysis

Create competitive win/loss model:

```
Customer: HHS [Agency]
Budget: $500K/year

Our Offer:
  SKUs: Compliance Monitor + Incident Response Engine
  Price: $280K/year (3-year = $840K)
  Timeline: 8 weeks to operational
  Compliance: 11/12 controls covered

Likely Competitors:
  1. Incumbent (current system + new module)
     Win Probability: 30% (switching costs)
  2. BigTech ServiceCo (3-year commitment, enterprise pricing)
     Win Probability: 50% (budget unknown, likely >$1M)
  3. 3rd-party compliance vendor + integration partner
     Win Probability: 20% (cheaper but slower)

Competitive Advantage:
  - Fastest deployment (8 weeks vs 20 weeks for competitors)
  - Built-in FedRAMP evidence (vs. post-integration assembly)
  - Fixed pricing (vs. variable with competitors)
  - dedicated compliance engineer (vs. 3rd-party SI)
```

### Deliverables (Day 15)
- ✅ Detailed technical requirements document (2–3 pages)
- ✅ SKU fit analysis for each recommended SKU (using template)
- ✅ Competitive landscape analysis
- ✅ Draft compliance bundle recommendation
- ✅ Compliance gap assessment (which controls are NOT covered, why)
- ✅ 3 customer references identified (for RFP response)

---

## Phase 4: Bid Strategy (Days 10–15)

### Objective
Finalize SKU selection, pricing strategy, and proposal approach. Align sales engineering findings with procurement/finance.

### 4.1 SKU Selection Decision

**Inputs**:
- Customer compliance requirements (from compliance-matrix.md)
- Customer budget constraints
- Competitive analysis
- Implementation timeline
- Customer team size / organization

**Output**: Recommended SKU bundle with rationale

**Example**:
```
RECOMMENDATION: Data Pack + Compliance Monitor + Integration Bundle

Rationale:
1. Covers 11/12 required NIST controls (gap: IR-2, recommend future enhancement)
2. Price: $320K/year (fits $500K budget, leaves 36% for integration)
3. Timeline: 8 weeks to operational (meets 12-week RFP deadline)
4. Customer team size: 25 people (Data Pack tier = 20 licenses + 5 admin seats)
5. Competitive advantage: Only vendor offering pre-built FedRAMP evidence

Confidence Level: HIGH (8.5/10)
```

### 4.2 Pricing Strategy

Use boe-pricing.md for pricing tier selection:

- **Tier Decision**:
  - Budget $250K–$500K → **Starter Tier** ($100K–$250K base SKU)
  - Budget $500K–$1.5M → **Standard Tier** ($250K–$750K base SKU)
  - Budget $1.5M+ → **Enterprise Tier** ($750K+ base SKU)

- **Volume Discounts**:
  - Single program (1 agency) → no discount (100%)
  - Multi-program (5+ agencies) → 10% discount (90%)
  - Large consortium (10+ agencies) → 20% discount (80%)

- **Proposal Pricing Approach**:
  - Option 1: Annual subscription only (cleanest)
  - Option 2: Annual subscription + usage-based overage (if customer wants)
  - Option 3: 3-year commitment with Year 1 discount (preferred, locks revenue)

### 4.3 Proposal Approach & Differentiation

**Capture Proposal Themes**:
1. **Compliance-First Design**: ggen SKUs are built from RDF compliance ontologies, not retrofitted compliance
2. **Deterministic Evidence**: Every control assessment produces cryptographic audit trails (not black-box assessments)
3. **Speed**: 8-week deployment vs. 20–26 weeks for competitors (50% faster)
4. **Built-in Integration**: Pre-built connectors for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes (vs. custom SI work)
5. **Fixed Pricing**: No surprise costs, no overage surprises (vs. variable enterprise pricing)

### Deliverables (Day 15)
- ✅ Final SKU bundle recommendation (with compliance coverage matrix)
- ✅ Pricing proposal (3-year preferred option, 1-year fallback)
- ✅ Competitive win/loss strategy
- ✅ Proposal differentiation themes (5 key messages)
- ✅ Implementation timeline (8-week Gantt chart)
- ✅ Risk register (top 5 deployment risks + mitigation)

---

---

## Phase 6: Proposal Submission (Days 28–30)

### Objective
Final review, sign-off, and submission before deadline.

### 6.1 Internal Review Checklist

**Legal & Compliance**:
- ✅ All insurance/bonding requirements addressed
- ✅ FAR/DFARS compliance (if government)
- ✅ Pricing authority approved (Finance)

---

## Phase 7: Contract Negotiation (Post-Submission)

### Objective
Win the contract and negotiate terms. Engage legal and finance teams.

### 7.1 Post-Submission Activities

**If Customer Requests Clarifications**:
- Respond within 24 hours (government procurement requires speed)
- Use formal "Proposal Clarification" memo (not email)
- Copy all stakeholders (Sales, Legal, Finance)
- Never commit to timeline/pricing changes without approval

**If Customer Wants Demos**:
- Schedule 30–60 min technical walkthrough
- Prepare demo environment (sanitized data, no real customer PII)
- Invite 3+ customer stakeholders (security, compliance, procurement)
- Collect feedback on proposal items (use feedback to strengthen negotiation position)

### 7.2 Legal Review & Contract Negotiation

**Standard Terms to Negotiate**:
- Performance requirements (tie to pricing, penalties for non-delivery)
- Insurance & bonding (typical: $1M liability, $250K performance bond)
- Compliance certification timeline (when evidence must be delivered)
- Payment terms (Net 30 standard, Net 45 for government)
- IP ownership (customer owns data, ggen owns software/templates)
- Termination clause (penalties for early termination)
- Confidentiality (NDA for sensitive data)

**Red Flags to Escalate**:
- ❌ Unlimited liability (demand cap)
- ❌ Customer owns all IP / source code escrow (not acceptable)
- ❌ Performance penalties >10% of contract value
- ❌ Payment terms >Net 60 (cash flow impact)
- ❌ Compliance certification in Year 1 (unrealistic, propose Year 1 evidence roadmap)

**Approval Limits**:
- Sales Lead: Can negotiate within ±10% of pricing
- VP Sales: Can approve up to ±20% discount + non-standard terms
- CFO: Can approve major financial terms, payment schedules
- General Counsel: All compliance, IP, liability terms

### Deliverables (Post-Submission)
- ✅ Negotiation log (issues, positions, resolutions)
- ✅ Final contract review (Legal approval)
- ✅ Signed contract (executed by both parties)
- ✅ Insurance certificates (proof of coverage)
- ✅ Performance bond (if contract >$250K)

---

## Phase 8: Win/Loss Analysis (Post-Close)

### Objective
Capture institutional learning: What worked? What didn't? How to improve next time?

### 8.1 Post-Win Debrief

**Interview Customer** (1 week after contract execution):

```
1. Compliance & Technical:
   - Which proposal sections were most persuasive?
   - Were C4 diagrams helpful?
   - Were there gaps in our compliance matrix that concerned you?

2. Pricing & Commercial:
   - Was pricing competitive vs. alternatives?
   - Would bundled pricing have helped?
   - Were there budget concerns we didn't address?

3. Team & Delivery:
   - Were our references credible?
   - Did sales team meet your expectations?
   - Any concerns about our ability to deliver?

4. Procurement Process:
   - How did we compare to other vendors?
   - Would you rate our proposal quality 1–10?
   - Any feedback for next engagement?
```

**Interview Sales Team** (same week):

```
1. What was the deciding factor?
   - Compliance maturity? Speed? Price? References?

2. Were there customer concerns we missed?
   - Hidden objections? Budget constraints?

3. What would we do differently next time?
   - Earlier engagement? Different SKU bundle? Pricing strategy?

4. Competitive intelligence:
   - Who else was bidding? Why did we win vs. them?
   - What are their strengths/weaknesses?
```

### 8.2 Post-Loss Debrief

**If We Lost**:

- **Interview Customer** (ask for debriefing call, mandatory for government):
  - "What was the winning vendor's key advantage?"

### 8.3 Lessons Learned Document

Create post-engagement summary:

```
Opportunity: HHS [Agency] FedRAMP Moderate Assessment
Engagement Duration: 30 days (capture to submission)
Decision: ✅ WIN

Key Success Factors:
1. Early compliance discovery (Day 5) - identified FedRAMP gap before RFP draft
2. C4 architecture diagrams - customer praised technical clarity
3. 3-year fixed pricing - undercut competitor's variable model by 40%
4. References from similar agencies - customer confidence +40%
5. 8-week deployment timeline - fastest in market

Lessons Learned:
1. Conduct discovery calls WITHIN 2 DAYS (we did Day 5, lost earlier urgency window)
2. Pre-draft compliance matrix for customer to review (vs. waiting for RFP requirements)
3. Include deployment Gantt chart in compliance bundle (helps customer project ROI)
4. Reach out to 5 references, not 3 (increases credibility)
5. Price bundled discount earlier in sales process (Day 10, not Day 15)

Process Improvements for Next Deal:
- Shorten discovery-to-strategy phase (Days 5–15 → Days 5–12)
- Pre-populate compliance matrix templates during qualification (Day 2)
- Create "proposal fast-track" playbook (reusable response templates)
- Conduct customer compliance survey (auto-map customer needs to SKUs)
```

| Compliance | FedRAMP Moderate + NIST 800-53 |
| Timeline | 12 weeks RFP → Award |
| Team Size | 25 people (security + ops) |
| Current Solution | [Incumbent name] (5 years) |

## Competitive Landscape

### Competitor 1: [Incumbent Vendor]

**Strengths**:
- Existing relationship (low switching cost)
- Familiar to customer
- Deep feature set

**Weaknesses**:
- No FedRAMP evidence (would need 9+ months to certify)
- Slow deployment (20+ weeks)
- High ongoing support costs

**Win Probability**: 35% (switching risk)

**Our Strategy**: Emphasize speed (8 weeks vs. 20 weeks) + compliance readiness (vs. 9-month certification path)

### Competitor 2: [BigTech Provider]

**Strengths**:
- Enterprise brand recognition
- Unlimited resources
- Large ecosystem

**Weaknesses**:
- Expensive ($750K+/year)
- Generic (not compliance-focused)
- Long sales cycle

**Win Probability**: 40% (budget constraints)

**Our Strategy**: Emphasize price (vs. $750K+) + compliance specialization (vs. generic platform)

### Competitor 3: [3rd-Party Compliance Vendor]

**Strengths**:
- Pure-play compliance vendor
- Attractive pricing ($180K/year)
- Specialized controls expertise

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires integration with 3 partners (slow deployment)
- Manual evidence assembly (not automated)
- No unified platform (customer maintains 4 tools)

**Win Probability**: 25% (fragmented solution)

**Our Strategy**: Emphasize unified platform (vs. 4 tools) + automated evidence (vs. manual assembly)

## Win/Loss Decision Tree

```
┌─ Can we compete on price? [MODERATE - We're $100K cheaper than incumbent]
├─ Can we compete on compliance? [STRONG - We have FedRAMP evidence ready]
├─ Can we compete on speed? [STRONG - 8 weeks vs. 20 weeks]
├─ Can we compete on team? [MODERATE - Customer knows them, we're less known]
└─ Overall Win Probability: 50–55%
```

## Winning Themes

1. **Speed Advantage**: "Reduce FedRAMP assessment time from 9 months to 4 months"
2. **Compliance-First Design**: "Every control built from compliance ontology, not bolted-on"
3. **Fixed Pricing**: "No surprise overage costs — $280K/year, 3-year fixed"
4. **Unified Platform**: "One tool for 11 controls, vs. 4 tools for 11 controls"
5. **Proven References**: "Three HHS agencies similar to you + similar compliance"

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Incumbent switching (customer stays with them) | 35% | Emphasize cost savings + faster time-to-compliance |
| Price sensitivity (customer picks BigTech) | 25% | Bundle discount + 3-year commitment (locks pricing) |
| Team familiarity (customer trusts competitor) | 30% | Deploy proof-of-concept (2-week trial of Compliance Monitor) |
| Timeline crunch (customer delays RFP) | 20% | Offer expedited proposal review (48-hour turnaround) |

## Recommendation

✅ **PROCEED** — Win probability 50–55%

**Primary Strategy**: Speed + compliance specialization (vs. price alone)
**Secondary Strategy**: References + proof-of-concept (reduce customer risk)
**Contingency**: 15% bundle discount if needed (approved by CFO)
