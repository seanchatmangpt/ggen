# Bill of Estimated (BOE) Pricing & Revenue Model

**Last Updated**: January 25, 2026 | **Version**: 2.0 | **Owner**: Finance/Sales Operations
**Classification**: Internal Use — Confidential | **Audience**: Sales, Finance, Leadership

## Executive Summary

The **ggen Pricing Model** is a subscription-based SaaS model optimized for government procurement. Key attributes:

- **Subscription Model**: Annual ($1 minimum, 3-year preferred) + optional usage-based tiers
- **3 Pricing Tiers**: Starter ($100K–$250K), Standard ($250K–$750K), Enterprise ($750K+)
- **15 SKUs**: Individual pricing + bundled discounts (15–40% savings)
- **Volume Discounts**: Multi-agency deals (5+ agencies = 10% off, 10+ = 20% off)
- **Margin Targets**: Gross margin 50–60%, Net margin 20–25%
- **Government-Realistic**: No commodity pricing; reflects compliance/support/infrastructure costs

**Revenue Model Strategy**:
- Primary: Annual subscription licensing (80% of revenue)
- Secondary: Professional services (implementation, training: 15% of revenue)
- Tertiary: Usage-based overages, premium support (5% of revenue)

---

## Pricing Philosophy: "Government-Grade Compliance = Premium Pricing"

**Key Insight**: Government customers aren't price-sensitive IF solution delivers compliance proof at lower cost-of-ownership than alternatives.

**Our Positioning**:
- **Not commodity**: Compliance isn't a checkbox; it's risk mitigation
- **Faster ROI**: FedRAMP certification in 12 weeks (vs. 18–24 months) = $X million in avoided delays
- **Built-in evidence**: 45+ audit artifacts ready (vs. customers assembling from 4 vendors)
- **Unified platform**: One dashboard for 11 controls (vs. customer managing 4 tools + integration)

**Pricing Justification**: "Our solution costs 20–30% more than point solutions, but saves customers 50–70% in integration + certification timeline + evidence assembly."

## Volume Discounts (Multi-Agency / Multi-Tenant)

Apply **additional** discount on top of bundle discount for customers managing multiple agencies/tenants.

### Volume Discount Ladder

| Number of Agencies | Discount | Example (Base $400K Bundle) | Savings/Year |
|-------------------|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 agency (single tenant) | — | $400K | — |
| 2–4 agencies (multi-tenant) | -5% | $380K | $20K |
| 5–9 agencies | -10% | $360K | $40K |
| 10–19 agencies | -15% | $340K | $60K |
| 20+ agencies (federal-wide) | -20% | $320K | $80K |

**Application Rules**:
- Discount applies to **first SKU bundle only** (the primary bundle for primary agency)
- Additional agencies get **50% discount on additional bundles** (vs. additional SKUs)
- Example: Federal customer with HHS (primary) + 5 other agencies
  - Primary HHS: $400K (base bundle, no volume discount if single-agency HHS)
  - Additional 5 agencies: 5 × ($400K × 50%) = $1M (50% of bundle price per agency)
  - Total: $1.4M for 6 agencies (vs. $2.4M if priced separately)
  - **Savings**: $1M (42% volume discount)

**3-Year Volume Commitment Bonus**:
- If 5+ agencies commit to 3-year contract: Additional -5% on final price
- Example: $400K bundle × 6 agencies × 50% = $1.2M base
- Apply volume discount: $1.2M × 85% (15% off) = $1.02M
- Apply 3-year bonus: $1.02M × 95% (5% off) = $969K total
- **3-year savings vs. annual**: $1.2M - $969K = $231K savings

## Cost Model & Margin Targets

### Cost Breakdown (per $400K deal, Standard Tier)

```
REVENUE: $400K/year (assumed)

COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):
├─ Software licensing (cloud platforms, libraries): $30K
├─ Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP compute/storage): $50K
├─ Support staff (2 FTE @ $75K salary, benefits): $150K
└─ Subtotal COGS: $230K
   └─ Gross Margin: 43% ($170K)

OPERATING EXPENSES:
├─ Sales & marketing (CAC recovery): $40K
├─ Overhead (rent, HR, finance): $30K
├─ R&D (product development, compliance audits): $20K
└─ Subtotal OpEx: $90K

NET PROFIT: $170K - $90K = $80K
NET MARGIN: 20%
```

### Margin Targets (Company-Wide)

**Target**:
- **Gross Margin**: 50–60% (industry SaaS avg: 70–75%, but compliance/support = higher COGS)
- **Net Margin**: 20–25% (after CAC + overhead)

**Justification**:
- Government compliance = higher COGS (audits, certification, 24/7 support)
- Faster ROI for customer justifies 10–15% premium vs. competitors
- 3-year contracts lock sustainable margin (less churn, better CAC recovery)

**Real Examples**:

| Deal Size | Gross Margin | Net Margin | Notes |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| $228K (Starter 1-year) | 52% | 25% | High CAC impact on 1-year deals |
| $615K (Starter 3-year) | 52% | 30% | 3-year lock improves margin |
| $408K (Standard 1-year) | 51% | 24% | Standard tier, proven customer |
| $1.041M (Standard 3-year) | 51% | 27% | Multi-year commitment |
| $950K (Enterprise 1-year) | 58% | 28% | High volume, lower support ratio |
| $2.28M (Enterprise 3-year) | 58% | 31% | Largest deals, best margins |

### COST & VALUE JUSTIFICATION

#### Customer's Cost of Ownership (TCO)

| Alternative | Cost | Timeline | Notes |
|-------------|------|----------|-------|
| **ggen (Proposed)** | $1.46M (3-yr) | 12 weeks to operational | Fastest, lowest total cost |
| Incumbent (maintain) | $950K (1-yr) + upgrade | 6 months | Slow, uncertain compliance |
| BigTech (enterprise) | $2.1M (3-yr) | 6–9 months | Enterprise, slower deployment |
| 3rd-party SI + tools | $1.8M (3-yr) + integration | 9–12 months | Manual assembly, slow |

**ggen Advantage**: $400K–$600K savings over 3 years vs. alternatives, PLUS 12-week deployment

#### ROI Calculation (Customer's perspective)

**Benefit 1: Faster FedRAMP Authorization**
- Industry standard: 18–24 months
- ggen accelerated: 12 months
- Savings: 6–12 months accelerated authorization
- Value: $X million avoided delay (customer specific)

**Benefit 2: Unified Evidence Platform**
- Previous solution: 4 separate tools + manual integration
- ggen: 1 platform, 45+ pre-built evidence artifacts
- Savings: ~$200K in integration costs + 800 manual hours

**Benefit 3: Continuous Monitoring (vs. annual audits)**
- Previous: Annual compliance audit ($50K–$100K)
- ggen: Real-time monitoring, quarterly reviews (fewer audit prep hours)
- Savings: ~$100K/year audit reduction

**Total Customer ROI**: $350K–$500K value created vs. $1.46M investment = ~30% ROI over 3 years

## Discount Authority & Approval Limits

**Who can approve what discounts**:

| Discount Level | Authority | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|
| <5% off | Sales Lead | Solo approval |
| 5–10% off | VP Sales | VP Sales signature |
| 10–15% off | VP Sales + CFO | Both signatures required |
| 15–25% off | CFO + CEO | Both signatures + board notification |
| >25% off | Board approval | Not recommended (below margin targets) |

**Common Scenarios**:
- Bundle discount (15–25% off): VP Sales + CFO approval
- Multi-year commitment discount (additional 5–10% off): VP Sales solo
- Multi-agency volume (additional 10–20% off): VP Sales + CFO
- Competitive rebid (matching competitor price): CFO approval only if margin >20%

---

## Financial Controls & Pricing Compliance

### Pricing Policy (Mandatory)

1. **No discounting below margin targets**:
   - Gross margin must never fall below 45%
   - Net margin must never fall below 18%

2. **3-Year Commitment Preference**:
   - Always suggest 3-year terms first
   - 1-year pricing = "premium" (no discount)
   - 3-year pricing = "standard" (10–15% discount)

3. **Volume Discount Logic**:
   - 5+ agencies = eligible for volume discount
   - Additional bundles for additional agencies = 50% off base bundle price
   - Multi-year volume bonus = additional 5% off

4. **Professional Services Pricing**:
   - Standard rates: $1.5K–$2K/day for implementation
   - Premium services: $2.5K–$3K/day for custom development
   - No discounting below $1K/day (covers cost + margin)

5. **Support Add-On Pricing**:
   - 24/7 support: +5% of annual subscription (fixed)
   - Dedicated success manager: +10% of annual subscription
   - Custom reporting: +3–5% of annual subscription

### Pricing Audit (Quarterly)

- Finance reviews all deals >$100K
- Verify discounts match authority limits
- Ensure gross margin ≥45% and net margin ≥18%
- Flag below-margin deals for leadership review
