## Known Issues to Document

### Minor Issues (Not Blocking)

1. **263 `.unwrap()` calls in production code**
   - Monitored in production
   - Being reviewed for v1.0.1
   - Error tracking configured

2. **Cleanroom integration 85-90% complete**
   - Manual testing sufficient for v1.0
   - Will be completed in v1.1
   - E2E testing framework functional

3. **6 `panic!` calls in test code**
   - Not production blocking
   - Will be replaced with assertions in v1.1

### Workarounds

- **If unwrap panic occurs:** Error tracking will capture context
- **Manual testing:** Use existing test suite until cleanroom complete
- **Performance:** Meets all SLOs, further optimization in v1.1

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found

1. **Immediate:** Revert to previous version
   ```bash
   git revert v1.0.0
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Rollback to stable"
