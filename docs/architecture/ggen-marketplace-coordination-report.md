# Ggen-Marketplace Coordination Report
## Queen Coordinator Strategic Directive

**Swarm ID:** `swarm_1760413745867_1ncd47vct`
**Mission:** Create standalone ggen-marketplace library for package distribution
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** 🟢 Strategic Planning Complete - Ready for Agent Deployment

---

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the strategic decisions and architectural direction for creating a standalone **ggen-marketplace** library that can be reused across multiple projects (ggen, clnrm, and future tools). The Queen Coordinator has analyzed the current codebase, evaluated trade-offs, and made definitive strategic decisions using the **Progressive Enhancement Architecture** pattern.

### Core Strategic Decision: 🎯 CENTRALIZED-FIRST WITH PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE

**Rationale:**
1. **Current State:** `ggen-core/src/registry.rs` (759 lines) is tightly coupled to ggen-core
2. **Production Priority:** 88/100 readiness score demands stable foundation first
3. **Complexity Management:** P2P/WASM add significant complexity that can destabilize MVP
4. **Future-Proofing:** Trait-based plugin system allows future enhancements without rewrite
5. **Proven Testing:** Leverage existing cleanroom framework (23+ integration tests)

---

## Strategic Decisions Matrix

| Decision Area | Choice | Rationale | Timeline |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Architecture Priority** | Centralized-first with P2P as optional plugin | Production readiness requires battle-tested centralized system. Plugin traits enable future P2P without rewrite. | Phase 1: Core (2-3 sprints)<br>Phase 3: P2P (Sprint 4+) |
| **WASM Plugins** | Optional feature with trait-based extensibility | WASM adds compilation complexity. Native Rust plugins cover 90% of use cases. Design traits first, WASM as one implementation. | Phase 2: Trait system<br>Phase 3: WASM runtime |
| **API Strategy** | REST API primary, GraphQL as future enhancement | REST is simpler to implement/test/consume. GraphQL adds complexity for uncertain marketplace benefit. | Phase 1: REST v1<br>Phase 3: Evaluate GraphQL |
| **Package Verification** | Mandatory signature verification with configurable trust models | Supply chain security is non-negotiable. ML-DSA (Dilithium3) already in ggen-core. Must be built-in, not bolted-on. | Phase 1: Mandatory sigs<br>Phase 2: Multiple trust models |

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Registry Implementation (`ggen-core/src/registry.rs`)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Working implementation with 759 lines of production code
- ✅ Comprehensive search with filtering (search, advanced_search, categories, keywords)
- ✅ Version resolution with semver compatibility checking
- ✅ File:// URL support for local testing
- ✅ Property-based testing with proptest (673 lines of tests)
- ✅ Proper error handling with anyhow::Context (no .unwrap()/.expect())

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Tightly coupled to ggen-core (imports from same crate)
- ❌ No signature verification (security gap)
- ❌ HTTP-only client (no storage abstraction)
- ❌ No plugin system (not reusable)
- ❌ Limited to GitHub Pages (no alternative backends)

**Integration Points:**
- Used by `ggen-cli-lib` for: search, add, packs, update, remove, categories
- Depends on: reqwest, serde, chrono, url, semver
- Testing: tempfile, mockito (mocking), proptest (property tests)

**Core Traits (Extensibility Foundation):**

```rust
/// Backend for fetching marketplace data
pub trait MarketplaceBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn fetch_index(&self) -> Result<RegistryIndex>;
    async fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>>;
    async fn resolve(&self, pack_id: &str, version: Option<&str>) -> Result<ResolvedPack>;
    async fn list_packages(&self) -> Result<Vec<PackMetadata>>;
}

/// Storage for installed packages
pub trait PackageStore: Send + Sync {
    async fn install(&self, pack: &ResolvedPack, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<InstalledPackage>;
    async fn list_installed(&self) -> Result<Vec<InstalledPackage>>;
    async fn remove(&self, pack_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_metadata(&self, pack_id: &str) -> Result<Option<InstalledPackage>>;
}

/// Package signature verification
pub trait PackageVerifier: Send + Sync {
    async fn verify(&self, pack: &ResolvedPack, data: &[u8]) -> Result<VerificationResult>;
    fn trust_model(&self) -> TrustModel;
}
```

**Migration Strategy from Current registry.rs:**

1. **Create ggen-marketplace crate** in workspace
2. **Copy registry.rs** as starting point
3. **Extract into traits** (MarketplaceBackend, PackageStore)
4. **Add security layer** (signature verification with ML-DSA)
5. **Update ggen-core** to import ggen-marketplace
6. **Migrate tests** to new crate structure
7. **Deprecate old registry.rs** with compatibility shim

---

### Phase 2: Plugin System & Extensibility (1 sprint)

**Objective:** Establish plugin architecture for advanced features

```rust
/// Plugin for extending marketplace functionality
pub trait MarketplacePlugin: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn version(&self) -> &str;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> Vec<PluginCapability>;

    // Lifecycle hooks
    async fn on_install(&self, pack: &ResolvedPack) -> Result<()>;
    async fn on_search(&self, query: &str, results: &mut Vec<SearchResult>) -> Result<()>;
    async fn on_verify(&self, pack: &ResolvedPack, verification: &VerificationResult) -> Result<()>;
}

/// Plugin capability flags
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum PluginCapability {
    CustomBackend,       // Provide alternative backend
    CustomVerification,  // Custom signature verification
    SearchEnhancement,   // Enhance search results (e.g., ML ranking)
    CacheStrategy,       // Custom caching logic
    Analytics,           // Usage analytics
}
```

**Native Plugin Examples:**

1. **Analytics Plugin:** Track install/search metrics
2. **Cache Plugin:** Smart cache invalidation
3. **Mirror Plugin:** Failover to alternative mirrors
4. **Search Enhancement:** NLP-based search ranking

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2+ sprints)

**Objective:** Optional P2P and WASM plugins for advanced use cases

#### P2P Plugin (`ggen-marketplace-p2p`)

```
ggen-marketplace-p2p/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs                    # P2P plugin implementation
│   ├── dht.rs                    # DHT-based package discovery
│   ├── gossip.rs                 # Gossip protocol for metadata
│   ├── reputation.rs             # Peer reputation system
│   └── backend.rs                # P2PBackend: MarketplaceBackend
├── Cargo.toml                    # Dependencies: libp2p
└── README.md
```

**Features:**
- DHT-based package discovery (no central registry)
- Gossip protocol for metadata propagation
- Peer reputation and trust scoring
- Fallback to centralized if P2P unavailable

#### WASM Plugin (`ggen-marketplace-wasm`)

```
ggen-marketplace-wasm/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs                    # WASM runtime integration
│   ├── runtime.rs                # wasmer/wasmtime runtime
│   ├── sandbox.rs                # Resource limits and sandboxing
│   └── interface.rs              # WASM plugin ABI
├── Cargo.toml                    # Dependencies: wasmer
└── README.md
```

**Features:**
- WASM-based plugins with resource limits
- Sandboxed execution (no filesystem/network access by default)
- Language-agnostic plugins (Rust, Go, Zig, etc.)
- Hot-reloadable plugins

---

## REST API Design (OpenAPI 3.0)

### Core Endpoints (Phase 1)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/packages` | Search packages with filters | No |
| GET | `/packages/{id}` | Get package metadata | No |
| GET | `/packages/{id}/versions` | List package versions | No |
| GET | `/packages/{id}/versions/{version}` | Download package version | No |
| POST | `/packages` | Publish new package | Yes |
| PUT | `/packages/{id}` | Update package metadata | Yes |
| DELETE | `/packages/{id}` | Remove package | Yes |
| GET | `/categories` | List categories with counts | No |
| GET | `/keywords` | List popular keywords | No |

### API Versioning Strategy

- **URL-based versioning:** `/v1/packages`, `/v2/packages`
- **Backward compatibility:** v1 supported for 12 months after v2 release
- **Deprecation headers:** `X-API-Deprecated: true`, `X-API-Sunset: 2026-01-01`

### Example OpenAPI Schema (Phase 1)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Ggen Marketplace API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Package distribution and discovery API

servers:
  - url: https://marketplace.ggen.dev/v1
    description: Production server
  - url: http://localhost:8080/v1
    description: Local development

paths:
  /packages:
    get:
      summary: Search packages
      parameters:
        - name: query
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: category
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: limit
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
            default: 20
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Search results
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/SearchResult'
```

---

## Security Architecture

### Package Signature Verification (Mandatory)

**Current State:** No signature verification in registry.rs
**Target State:** Mandatory verification with ML-DSA (Dilithium3)

**Implementation:**

1. **Signature Format:**
   ```
   package.tar.gz           # Package contents
   package.tar.gz.sig       # ML-DSA signature
   package.tar.gz.pubkey    # Publisher public key
   ```

2. **Verification Flow:**
   ```
   1. Download package + signature + public key
   2. Verify signature using ML-DSA (quantum-resistant)
   3. Check trust model (CA, WoT, pinning)
   4. Compare sha256 hash with registry index
   5. Only install if all checks pass
   ```

3. **Trust Models:**
   - **Centralized CA:** Central authority signs all packages (default)
   - **Web of Trust:** Community reputation system (like GPG)
   - **Key Pinning:** Trust specific publisher keys (like TOFU)
   - **Self-Signed:** Allow with explicit user confirmation

4. **Configuration Example:**
   ```toml
   # ~/.ggen/config.toml
   [marketplace.security]
   trust_model = "centralized_ca"
   require_signatures = true
   allow_self_signed = false
   pinned_keys = [
       "io.ggen.official:abcd1234...",
   ]
   ```

### Threat Model & Mitigations

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Supply chain poisoning** | CRITICAL | Mandatory signature verification with ML-DSA |
| **Man-in-the-middle** | HIGH | HTTPS only, certificate pinning |
| **Package tampering** | HIGH | SHA256 hash verification |
| **Key compromise** | HIGH | Key rotation, revocation lists |
| **Malicious packages** | MEDIUM | Sandboxed verification, code review |

---

## Integration Strategy

### With ggen (Current Project)

**Current:**
- `ggen-core/src/registry.rs` tightly coupled to ggen-core
- CLI commands: search, add, packs, update, remove, categories

**Migration Path:**
1. Create `ggen-marketplace` crate in workspace
2. Extract registry.rs → ggen-marketplace/src/backend/centralized.rs
3. Add security layer (signature verification)
4. Update `ggen-core/Cargo.toml`: `ggen-marketplace = { path = "../ggen-marketplace" }`
5. Replace imports: `use ggen_marketplace::*;`
6. Deprecate old registry.rs with compatibility shim
7. Update tests to use cleanroom framework

**CLI Changes:** Minimal - same commands, different backend

### With clnrm (Cleanroom Testing Framework)

**Approach:**
- Import `ggen-marketplace` as dependency
- Use plugin system for clnrm-specific behavior
- Custom package verification for cleanroom policies

**Example:**
```rust
// clnrm/src/marketplace.rs
use ggen_marketplace::{MarketplaceBackend, PackageVerifier};

struct CleanroomVerifier {
    policy: CleanroomPolicy,
}

impl PackageVerifier for CleanroomVerifier {
    async fn verify(&self, pack: &ResolvedPack, data: &[u8]) -> Result<VerificationResult> {
        // Custom verification logic for cleanroom isolation
        self.policy.validate_package(pack)?;
        // ... signature verification
    }
}
```

### With Other Projects

**Public API:**
```rust
// As library
use ggen_marketplace::{Marketplace, CentralizedBackend};

let marketplace = Marketplace::builder()
    .backend(CentralizedBackend::new("https://marketplace.ggen.dev")?)
    .cache_dir("/tmp/cache")
    .trust_model(TrustModel::CentralizedCA)
    .build()?;

let results = marketplace.search("rust cli").await?;
```

**Optional CLI Tool:**
```bash
# Standalone CLI (optional)
cargo install ggen-marketplace-cli

ggen-marketplace search "rust web"
ggen-marketplace install io.ggen.rust.web-server
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Tight coupling in registry.rs** | HIGH | HIGH | Architect designs clean extraction strategy with traits |
| **Premature P2P/WASM optimization** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Strict phase gating - no Phase 3 until Phase 1 complete |
| **API breaking changes** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Semantic versioning + 12-month deprecation policy |
| **Security verification bypass** | CRITICAL | LOW | Security auditor reviews all code + external audit |
| **Performance regression** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Benchmark suite + performance gates in CI |
| **Plugin API instability** | MEDIUM | LOW | Dogfood plugins internally before public release |
| **Multi-project adoption resistance** | LOW | LOW | Provide migration guides + support |

## Coordination Protocol

### Memory Sharing Strategy

All agents MUST use these memory keys for coordination:

```bash
# READ strategic decisions
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm_1760413745867_1ncd47vct"

# READ agent assignments
ggen-marketplace/.swarm/memory.db → swarm/shared/royal-directives

# WRITE progress updates
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit \
  --file "path/to/deliverable" \
  --memory-key "swarm/[agent-name]/[deliverable]"

# NOTIFY other agents
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify \
  --message "[Agent Name]: Completed [deliverable]"
```

### Agent Communication Flow

```
Queen Coordinator
    ↓ (issues directives)
Architect → Design decisions → Memory
    ↓ (traits defined)
Rust Engineer → Implementation → Memory
    ↓ (API contracts)
API Designer → OpenAPI spec → Memory
    ↓ (security requirements)
Security Auditor → Verification system → Memory
    ↓ (test requirements)
Test Engineer → Test suite → Memory
    ↓ (advanced features)
P2P + WASM Specialists → Plugins → Memory
```

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

1. **Architect has final say** on architectural decisions
2. **Security Auditor can veto** security-compromising designs
3. **Queen Coordinator arbitrates** deadlocks
4. **Consensus required** for breaking API changes
