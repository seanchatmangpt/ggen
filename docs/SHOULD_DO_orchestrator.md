# RegenerationOrchestrator - SHOULD DO Documentation

**File**: `ggen-ai/src/autonomous/orchestrator.rs`
**Purpose**: Machine-timescale orchestration with parallel execution
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**WHAT IT SHOULD DO**: Orchestrate autonomous regeneration workflows at machine timescale (<30 seconds target), processing multiple change events in parallel with adaptive optimization, health monitoring, and telemetry collection. Should act as the "conductor" coordinating RegenerationEngine, DeploymentAutomation, and TelemetryCollector.

**NOT**: A simple event loop or batch processor. It should be an intelligent, self-optimizing orchestration layer that meets strict latency SLAs.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Intent

### Design Principles

1. **Machine Timescale**: Should operate at <30 second cycle times (configurable)
2. **Parallel Execution**: Should maximize throughput via concurrent event processing
3. **Adaptive Optimization**: Should self-tune based on performance metrics
4. **Autonomous Operation**: Should run continuously without human intervention
5. **Observability**: Should emit detailed telemetry and health metrics
6. **Fault Tolerance**: Should continue operating despite partial failures
7. **Resource Awareness**: Should respect concurrency limits and backpressure

---

## 📋 Component Contracts

### OrchestratorConfig

**SHOULD DO**:
- Define operational parameters (autonomous mode, concurrency, target cycle time)
- Support adaptive optimization toggle
- Configure health check intervals
- Provide sensible defaults based on system resources
- Be serializable for persistence and configuration management

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**:
- `autonomous: true` - Enable autonomous operation by default
- `max_concurrent: num_cpus::get()` - Use all available CPU cores
- `target_cycle_ms: 30000` - Target 30-second cycles
- `adaptive_optimization: true` - Enable self-tuning
- `health_check_interval_secs: 60` - Check health every minute

**SHOULD NOT**:
- Allow invalid configurations (e.g., max_concurrent: 0)
- Use hardcoded values (derive from system)
- Ignore performance characteristics

---

### RegenerationOrchestrator

**SHOULD DO**:
- Coordinate RegenerationEngine, DeploymentAutomation, TelemetryCollector
- Manage orchestrator lifecycle (start/stop/running state)
- Execute regeneration cycles with parallel event processing
- Track and report orchestration statistics
- Emit telemetry for all significant operations
- Self-optimize when cycle times exceed target
- Run periodic health checks
- Provide thread-safe access to shared state

**SHOULD MAINTAIN**:
- `OrchestrationStats`: Total cycles, average cycle time, events processed, deployments
- Running state with proper synchronization (RwLock)
- References to regeneration engine, deployment system, telemetry
- Change notifier for event publishing

**SHOULD NOT**:
- Process events directly (delegate to RegenerationEngine)
- Deploy artifacts directly (delegate to DeploymentAutomation)
- Block on I/O operations (use async everywhere)
- Allow concurrent start() calls (enforce single instance)

---

## 🔄 Lifecycle Management Contract

### Start Operation

**SHOULD DO**:
1. Verify not already running (return error if running)
2. Set running state to true atomically
3. Log startup with configuration details
4. Record telemetry event (RegenerationStarted)
5. Start RegenerationEngine
6. Spawn health check loop task (if configured)
7. Return success only after all components started

**SHOULD NOT**:
- Start if already running
- Return success if any component fails to start
- Start without proper state initialization
- Forget to clean up on failure

---

### Stop Operation

**SHOULD DO**:
1. Set running state to false atomically
2. Wait for current cycle to complete gracefully
3. Stop health check loop
4. Record telemetry event (RegenerationCompleted)
5. Log shutdown confirmation
6. Release all resources

**SHOULD NOT**:

- Lose in-progress telemetry

---

### Health Check Loop

**SHOULD DO**:
1. Run at configured interval
2. Check running state (stop if false)
3. Collect current metrics from telemetry
4. Read orchestration statistics
5. Log health summary (cycles, avg time, success rate)
6. Record health check telemetry
7. Alert on anomalies (low success rate, high latency)
8. Continue until stopped

**SHOULD DETECT**:
- Success rate < 90% (warn)
- Average cycle time > target (warn)

## 🔧 Refactoring Guidance

When refactoring this file, preserve these key behaviors:

1. **Autonomous operation** - Start once, run forever
2. **Parallel execution** - Always process events concurrently
3. **Statistics tracking** - Record all significant operations
4. **Telemetry emission** - Log everything for observability
5. **Health monitoring** - Continuous self-checks
6. **Adaptive optimization** - Self-tune when needed

Improve these areas:

1. **Break down execute_cycle** (91 lines → 3-4 functions of <30 lines)
   - Extract: `initialize_execution()`
   - Extract: `process_events_and_collect_results()`
   - Extract: `finalize_execution()`
   - Extract: `check_performance_targets()`

2. **Add circuit breakers** - Stop calling failing components temporarily
3. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Add priority queues** - Process critical events first
5. **Add distributed coordination** - Support multi-node orchestration
6. **Improve error recovery** - Retry with exponential backoff
7. **Add cost tracking** - Monitor resource consumption
8. **Add predictive scaling** - Scale before load hits
