## Sales Playbook

### Discovery Call Script (15 min)

> "Hi [Prospect]. We automated operations at Disney—turned a 45-minute opening checklist into 8 minutes. We're looking for 2-3 early partners to prove this works in healthcare and finance. Do you have 45 minutes to explore if it makes sense for [Company]?"

### Qualification Questions (BANT)

- **Budget**: "When budget season arrives, would you have $500k-$2M for ops automation?"
- **Authority**: "Who decides on ops automation projects? CFO? COO? Both?"
- **Need**: "What's your biggest ops pain? Time waste? Errors? Compliance?"
- **Timeline**: "If you saw this could save 30% of ops time, when would you want to start?"

### Pain Point Deep Dive

> "Tell me about [specific process]. How long does it take? How many errors per week? Who complains most? What's the ROI if you cut that in half?"

### Solution Pitch (3 minutes)

> "We do this in three steps:
> 1. Reverse-engineer your process into a specification (2 weeks)
> 2. Automate the decisions (4 weeks)
> 3. Go live with audit trail + rollback (2 weeks)
>
> You get: 25-50% cycle time reduction, zero job elimination (architects, not fired), every decision auditable.
> Total: 8 weeks, $100-150k, guaranteed ROI in Year 1."

### Close (Ask for Next Step)

> "Sounds like we're aligned on the pain and the solution. Let's run a 1-week scoping workshop with your CTO + ops lead. We'll map out 1 process, estimate effort, and show you the exact ROI. No obligation—just exploration. Can we schedule that for next week?"

**Expansion Revenue** ($ of existing customer base):
- Year 1: 1 process/customer (baseline)
- Year 2: +2 processes/customer (expansion) = 15% ARR expansion

**Expansion Pricing**:

- Process 3: $80k (additional process, marginal cost)
