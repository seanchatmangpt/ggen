## 🛠️ Do (How-to Guides)

**Looking to solve a specific problem? These are task-oriented guides.**

### Compilation & Build
- **[Fix Compilation Errors](diataxis/how-to/fix-compilation-errors.md)** - Handle E0277 (trait bounds), E0308 (type mismatches), E0283 (ambiguity), E0599 (method not found)
- **[Eliminate Test Warnings](diataxis/how-to/eliminate-test-warnings.md)** - Achieve zero warnings: unused imports, variables, dead code, deprecated APIs

### Test Quality
- **[Refactor Tests with Lean](diataxis/how-to/refactor-tests-with-lean.md)** - Apply Mura (inconsistency) and Muda (waste) elimination to test suites
- **[Run Gemba Walk](diataxis/how-to/run-gemba-walk.md)** - Inspect test quality using 8-point checklist (observability, isolation, clarity, edge cases)

### System Design
- **[Implement Andon System](diataxis/how-to/implement-andon-system.md)** - Set up rapid failure detection with yellow (1-5 failures) and red (6+) alerts

**When to Use:**
- Compilation broken → Fix Compilation Errors
- Tests passing but warnings present → Eliminate Test Warnings
- Tests slow/flaky → Refactor Tests with Lean
- Quality unknown → Run Gemba Walk
- Need failure alerts → Implement Andon System

## 💡 Understand (Explanations)

**Want to understand the philosophy and reasoning behind our approach?**

### Design Philosophy
- **[Why Poka-Yoke Prevents Errors](diataxis/explanations/why-poka-yoke-prevents-errors.md)** - How compile-time mistake-proofing eliminates runtime failures (5 patterns: guide pin, limit switches, fail-safe, counter, sequencing)

- **[Why Lean Manufacturing Works](diataxis/explanations/why-lean-manufacturing-works.md)** - How Toyota Production System principles (Mura/Muda/Muri) apply to software testing

- **[Why Zero Warnings Matters](diataxis/explanations/why-zero-warnings-matters.md)** - The compiler as design feedback tool: warnings are design smells, not noise

### Architectural Patterns
- **[Why Hive Mind Coordinates](diataxis/explanations/why-hive-mind-coordinates.md)** - Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for multi-agent coordination (Queen → Colonies → Workers)

- **[Why Chicago-TDD Improves Tests](diataxis/explanations/why-chicago-tdd-improves-tests.md)** - Inside-out vs outside-in testing: when real collaborators beat mocks

**Mental Models:**
- Poka-Yoke → Make errors impossible at compile time
- Lean → Eliminate waste, inconsistency, overburden
- Hive Mind → Decentralized coordination with consensus
- Chicago TDD → Real integration over mock isolation
