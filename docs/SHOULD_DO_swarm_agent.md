# SwarmAgent - SHOULD DO Documentation

**File**: `agents/src/agents/swarm_agent.rs`
**Purpose**: Autonomous coordination for self-generating workflows
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

---

## üéØ Core Purpose

**WHAT IT SHOULD DO**: Enable autonomous, self-organizing agents to respond to system triggers (requirements changes, telemetry, API changes, security vulnerabilities, performance regressions) by automatically analyzing, planning, and executing multi-step regeneration workflows across the entire codebase.

**NOT**: A simple event handler or task executor. It should be a intelligent, autonomous system capable of reasoning about changes and orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Intent

### Design Principles

1. **Autonomous Operation**: Should operate without human intervention once triggered
2. **Trigger-Driven**: Should react to 5 types of system triggers automatically
3. **Multi-Step Workflows**: Should coordinate complex sequences (analyze ‚Üí extend ‚Üí query ‚Üí regenerate)
4. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Should extend and query the knowledge graph to understand context
5. **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Should use LLM clients to analyze and make intelligent decisions
6. **MCP Integration**: Should leverage MCP tools for graph operations, template updates, and code generation
7. **Result Tracking**: Should record all actions taken and artifacts generated
