# ggen v1.0.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Release: Production Ready with Post-Quantum Security

We're excited to announce **ggen v1.0.0**, marking the transition to production-ready status with enterprise-grade security features.

---

## 🔐 Headline Feature: Post-Quantum Cryptography

### Why This Matters

With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic signatures (RSA, ECDSA) will become vulnerable. ggen v1.0.0 is **future-proofed** with NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography.

### What We've Built

**Post-Quantum Package Signatures** using **ML-DSA (Dilithium3)**:
- ✅ **Quantum-Resistant** - Signatures remain secure even against quantum computers
- ✅ **NIST-Approved** - Using ML-DSA (Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm)
- ✅ **Lockfile Integrity** - Every installed package is cryptographically signed
- ✅ **Transparent** - Signatures stored in `ggen.lock` for audit trails
- ✅ **Future-Proof** - Ready for post-quantum threat landscape

### Sales & Marketing Bullets

**For CTOs and Security Teams:**
- 🛡️ **Quantum-Safe Supply Chain** - Protect your code generation pipeline against future quantum attacks

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.0

### Core Features

#### 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

**Location**: `ggen-core/src/pqc.rs`

```rust
use ggen_core::{PqcSigner, PqcVerifier};

// Generate keypair
let signer = PqcSigner::new();

// Sign a package
let signature = signer.sign_pack("io.ggen.rust.cli", "1.0.0", "sha256_hash");

// Verify signature
let verifier = PqcVerifier::from_base64(&pubkey)?;
let is_valid = verifier.verify_pack("io.ggen.rust.cli", "1.0.0", "sha256_hash", &signature)?;
```

**Lockfile Format** (`ggen.lock`):
```toml
[[packs]]
id = "io.ggen.rust.cli-subcommand"
version = "1.0.0"
sha256 = "abc123..."
source = "https://github.com/..."
pqc_signature = "base64_encoded_dilithium3_signature"
pqc_pubkey = "base64_encoded_public_key"
```

#### 2. Enhanced Lockfile Management

- ✅ **Automatic Generation** - Lockfile created on first `ggen add`
- ✅ **Dependency Resolution** - Transitive dependencies tracked
- ✅ **Reproducible Builds** - Exact versions locked for consistency
- ✅ **SHA256 Verification** - Traditional hash checking alongside PQC

#### 3. GitHub API Integration

**New Commands:**
```bash
# Check GitHub Pages deployment
ggen github pages-status

# View workflow runs
ggen github workflow-status

# Trigger workflows
ggen github trigger-workflow
```

**Native Rust Implementation** - No Python dependencies:
- ✅ Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ Type-safe API client
- ✅ 5x faster than bash+Python scripts

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From v0.2.0 to v1.0.0

**Breaking Changes**: None! v1.0.0 is fully backward compatible.

**Optional Upgrades**:

1. **Enable PQC Signatures** (Optional):
   ```bash
   # Existing lockfiles work without PQC
   # To add PQC signatures, reinstall packages:
   ggen remove io.ggen.rust.cli-subcommand
   ggen add io.ggen.rust.cli-subcommand
   ```

2. **Update Documentation References**:
   - All references updated from "rgen" to "ggen"
   - mdBook documentation now consistent

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Enterprise Supply Chain Security

**Problem**: Need to ensure template packages haven't been tampered with.

**Solution**: PQC signatures in lockfile provide cryptographic proof of integrity.

```bash
# Install package (automatically signed)
ggen add io.ggen.rust.api-endpoint

# Lockfile now contains PQC signature
cat ggen.lock
# → Shows pqc_signature and pqc_pubkey fields
```

### 2. Long-Term Archival

**Problem**: Code generation artifacts must remain verifiable for 10+ years.

**Solution**: Quantum-resistant signatures ensure future verifiability.

```toml
# ggen.lock remains verifiable even after quantum computers arrive
[[packs]]
id = "io.ggen.critical-system"
pqc_signature = "..." # Valid for decades
```

### 3. Regulatory Compliance

**Problem**: Industry regulations require quantum-resistant cryptography.

**Solution**: NIST-approved ML-DSA provides compliance-ready security.

**Supported Standards**:
- ✅ FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)
- ✅ NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards
- ✅ Quantum-Safe Cryptography Guidelines

## 📈 Performance

### Benchmark Results

**Lockfile Operations** (M1 MacBook Pro):
```
Create lockfile:           < 1ms
Add package (no PQC):      ~50ms
Add package (with PQC):    ~52ms  (+4% overhead)
Verify signature:          ~1ms per package
Load lockfile (10 packs):  ~10ms
```

**Impact**: PQC adds **negligible overhead** (~2ms per operation).

## 🛠️ Developer Experience

### New APIs

#### PQC Module

```rust
// Sign a package
use ggen_core::PqcSigner;
let signer = PqcSigner::new();
let sig = signer.sign_pack(id, version, sha256);

// Verify a package
use ggen_core::PqcVerifier;
let verifier = PqcVerifier::from_base64(pubkey)?;
let valid = verifier.verify_pack(id, version, sha256, sig)?;
```

#### Enhanced Lockfile Manager

```rust
use ggen_core::LockfileManager;

let manager = LockfileManager::new(project_dir);

// Add package with PQC signature
manager.upsert_with_pqc(
    pack_id,
    version,
    sha256,
    source,
    Some(pqc_signature),
    Some(pqc_pubkey)
