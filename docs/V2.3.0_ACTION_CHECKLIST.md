## Notes

### Why This Approach Works
1. **Ship fast**: Working features available immediately
2. **Fail fast**: Discover issues quickly with real users
3. **Iterate fast**: Improve based on actual feedback
4. **Learn fast**: Validate assumptions before P2P investment

### What Could Go Wrong
1. **Users expect P2P**: Mitigated by clear communication
2. **Marketplace bugs**: Mitigated by 626 passing tests
3. **Performance issues**: Mitigated by benchmarks
4. **Competition**: First-mover advantage by shipping now

### Worst Case Scenario
- Critical bug found → Patch release within 24 hours
- P2P demand is low → Pivot to centralized registry
- Performance problems → Optimization in v2.3.1
- User adoption low → Marketing and feature improvements
