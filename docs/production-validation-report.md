---

## 3. Security Validation

### ✅ PASSED - Good Security Practices

#### API Key Protection

**SecretString Implementation** (`ggen-ai/src/security.rs`):
```rust

✅ Automatic masking in Display trait
✅ Automatic masking in Serialize trait
✅ Regex-based pattern masking for logs
✅ Comprehensive test coverage (12 tests)
```

**Masked Patterns:**
- OpenAI keys (sk-...)
- Anthropic keys (sk-ant-...)
- Bearer tokens
- Generic API keys

**Test Evidence:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_mask_openai_key() {
    let input = "Error with API key sk-1234567890abcdefghijklmnop";
    let masked = mask_sensitive_patterns(input);
    assert!(masked.contains("sk-1..."));
    assert!(!masked.contains("sk-1234567890"));
}
```

#### Governance & Safety

**Policy Engine** (`ggen-ai/src/governance/policy.rs`):
- ✅ Policy-based constraints
- ✅ Rate limiting (framework)
- ✅ Mutation limits
- ✅ Allow/block lists
- ✅ Custom conditions (extensible)

**Safety Controller** (`ggen-ai/src/governance/safety.rs`):
- ✅ Emergency stop mechanism
- ✅ Rollback support
- ✅ Validation gates
- ✅ State snapshots
- ✅ Safety violation tracking

**Security Score: 8/10**

**Concerns:**
- Need to verify policy enforcement in live system
- Rate limiting not fully implemented (TODO markers)
