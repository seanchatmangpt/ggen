## 🚀 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Setup
- [x] Research mocking libraries
- [x] Add mockall to Cargo.toml
- [x] Create documentation
- [ ] Review documentation (next step)

### Phase 2: Traits
- [ ] Create `lifecycle/traits.rs`
- [ ] Define `CommandExecutor` trait
- [ ] Define `StateManager` trait
- [ ] Define `TimeProvider` trait
- [ ] Implement real versions

### Phase 3: Refactor
- [ ] Refactor `exec.rs` for DI
- [ ] Update `Context` struct
- [ ] Update `run_phase()` function
- [ ] Update `run_pipeline()` function

### Phase 4: Tests
- [ ] Create `exec_test.rs`
- [ ] Write unit tests (10+ tests)
- [ ] Verify coverage (80%+ target)
- [ ] Run all tests

### Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] Ensure integration tests still pass
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Merge to main

## 💻 Code Examples Summary

### Basic Test Pattern

```rust
#[test]
fn test_behavior() {
    // ARRANGE
    let mut mock = MockCommandExecutor::new();
    mock.expect_execute()
        .with(eq("npm test"))
        .times(1)
        .returning(|_, _, _| Ok(()));

    // ACT
    let result = execute_phase(&mock, &phase);

    // ASSERT
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

### Trait Definition

```rust
#[cfg_attr(test, automock)]
pub trait CommandExecutor {
    fn execute(&self, cmd: &str, cwd: &Path, env: &[(String, String)]) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### Sequence Verification

```rust
let mut seq = Sequence::new();

mock.expect_execute()
    .with(eq("lint"))
    .in_sequence(&mut seq)
    .returning(|_, _, _| Ok(()));

mock.expect_execute()
    .with(eq("build"))
    .in_sequence(&mut seq)
    .returning(|_, _, _| Ok(()));
```
