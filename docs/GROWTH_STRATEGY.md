# ggen Growth Strategy 2025-2027

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

ggen is uniquely positioned to revolutionize code generation by combining deterministic RDF knowledge graphs with AI-powered generation. However, current barriers—particularly a 15-25 minute time-to-first-success—are preventing market adoption. This strategy focuses on three key pillars:

1. **Radical Onboarding Simplification** (<5 min to success)
2. **Clear Market Positioning** (vs. AI copilots and template engines)
3. **Flywheel Effect** (users → contributors → template authors → more users)

**90-Day Goal:** Reduce time-to-first-success from 15-25 minutes to <3 minutes
**6-Month Goal:** 1,000+ active users, 50+ marketplace templates
**12-Month Goal:** 10,000+ users, enterprise pilot program, conference presence

---

## 1. Market Positioning Analysis

### 2.1 30-Second Quickstart (Week 1-2)

**The "Copy-Paste Success" Command:**

```bash
# Single command that WORKS on first try
curl -fsSL https://ggen.dev/install.sh | sh && ggen quickstart rust-web-api my-api
```

**What it does (behind the scenes):**
1. Installs ggen CLI (with progress bar)
2. Downloads most popular template (rust-web-api)
3. Generates project with sane defaults
4. Runs `cargo build && cargo test` (shows passing tests)
5. Prints:
   ```
   ✅ Your API is ready! Next steps:

   cd my-api
   cargo run          # Start server on :8080
   ggen add feature   # Add authentication, database, etc.

   📖 Tutorial: https://ggen.dev/getting-started

- **Enterprise Features:** Private marketplace, SSO, analytics (must-haves)
- **Case Studies:** Show ROI with quantitative metrics
- **Sales Team:** Hire experienced enterprise AEs

**Early Warning Signs:**
- No enterprise pilots by Month 9
- Lost deals due to missing features (SOC 2, SSO)
- Long sales cycles (>6 months)

---

### 12.5 Funding Risk: "Run Out of Money"

**Risk:** Can't raise funding or revenue misses targets

**Mitigation:**
- **Lean Operations:** Keep burn rate low (<$60K/month)
- **Revenue Focus:** Launch paid features early (Month 6)
- **Fundraising Prep:** Build pitch deck, identify investors early
- **Extend Runway:** Cut non-essential costs if needed

**Early Warning Signs:**
- <6 months runway remaining
- Revenue significantly below projections
- Investors not interested (fundraising feedback)

---
