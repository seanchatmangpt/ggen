# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made in the Cleanroom Testing Framework.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand:

- Why a particular solution was chosen
- What alternatives were considered
- What trade-offs were accepted
- What constraints influenced the decision

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-backend-abstraction.md) | Backend Abstraction Design | Accepted | 2024-10 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-singleton-containers.md) | Singleton Container Pattern | Accepted | 2024-10 |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-deterministic-execution.md) | Deterministic Execution Approach | Accepted | 2024-10 |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-error-hierarchy.md) | Error Handling Hierarchy | Accepted | 2024-10 |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-security-isolation.md) | Security Isolation Strategy | Accepted | 2024-10 |
| [ADR-006](ADR-006-resource-monitoring.md) | Resource Monitoring Architecture | Accepted | 2024-10 |

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- Benefits and improvements

### Negative
- Drawbacks and limitations

### Neutral
- Trade-offs and considerations

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?

## References
- Links to relevant documentation, RFCs, or external resources
```

## Creating a New ADR

When proposing a new ADR:

1. Copy the template from `ADR-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (next available number)
3. Give it a descriptive title
4. Fill in all sections thoughtfully
5. Submit for review via pull request
6. Update this README once accepted

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for historical context
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (reference the new ADR)
