Feature: Coverage Analysis and Reporting
  As a developer
  I want to analyze test coverage and generate reports
  So that I can ensure comprehensive testing

  Background:
    Given I have a clean test environment

  Scenario: Basic coverage analysis
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    When I generate a coverage report
    Then the coverage report should be generated
    And the coverage report should show "Summary"

  Scenario: Coverage threshold validation
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have a coverage threshold of 80%
    When I check coverage against threshold
    Then the coverage should meet the threshold

  Scenario: File-specific coverage analysis
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have coverage data for "main.rs"
    When I analyze coverage for "main.rs"
    Then the coverage analysis should identify uncovered lines

  Scenario: Branch coverage analysis
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have branch coverage data
    When I generate a coverage report
    Then the branch coverage should be reported

  Scenario: Coverage export in JSON format
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    When I export coverage data to "json"
    Then the coverage data should be exported in "json" format

  Scenario: Coverage export in XML format
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    When I export coverage data to "xml"
    Then the coverage data should be exported in "xml" format

  Scenario: Coverage export in HTML format
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    When I export coverage data to "html"
    Then the coverage data should be exported in "html" format

  Scenario: Comprehensive coverage report
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have coverage data for "main.rs"
    And I have coverage data for "lib.rs"
    And I have branch coverage data
    When I generate a coverage report
    Then the coverage report should be comprehensive
    And the coverage metrics should be accurate

  Scenario: Coverage tracking for multiple files
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have coverage data for "main.rs"
    And I have coverage data for "lib.rs"
    And I have coverage data for "utils.rs"
    When I generate a coverage report
    Then the coverage should be tracked for "main.rs"
    And the coverage should be tracked for "lib.rs"
    And the coverage should be tracked for "utils.rs"

  Scenario: Coverage threshold failure
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have a coverage threshold of 95%
    When I check coverage against threshold
    Then the coverage should be at least 95%

  Scenario: Coverage report with detailed metrics
    Given I have coverage analysis enabled
    And I have a coverage report "detailed_coverage.json"
    When I generate a coverage report
    Then the coverage report should show "Lines"
    And the coverage report should show "Functions"
    And the coverage report should show "Branches"
