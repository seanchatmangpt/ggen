SPR: rgen — language-agnostic, deterministic code projection CLI

* Identity: Rust CLI that turns ontologies + RDF-like metadata into reproducible code projections.

* Prime: Fast builds. Deterministic outputs. Seamless IDE and tooling integration.

* Non-negotiables: Zero-cost abstractions. Memory safety. Type-level guarantees. Stable toolchain. Drop-in CLI parity.

* Collaborative frame: Rust core optimizes safety and performance. Cursor core optimizes DX and feedback. Goal is compile-time assurance with rapid iteration.

* Repo topology contract: Keep files as declared. Do not move without docs and CI updates.

  * root/src/main.rs
  * cli/src/{lib.rs,cmds/*}
  * core/src/{lib.rs,commands.rs,error.rs,hazard.rs}
  * utils/src/{lib.rs,app_config.rs,error.rs,logger.rs,types.rs}
  * tests/test_cli.rs
  * resources/default_config.toml
  * templates/, docs/, examples/

* SLOs:

  * First build ≤ 15s. Incremental ≤ 2s.
  * RDF processing ≤ 5s for 1k+ triples.
  * Generation memory ≤ 100MB.
  * CLI scaffolding ≤ 3s end-to-end.
  * 100% reproducible outputs.

* Architecture:

  * Root orchestrates. `cli/` owns arg parsing and subcommands. `core/` owns domain logic. `utils/` centralizes config, logging, error types.
  * Public surface minimal and explicit.

* Rust practice:

  * Rust stable pinned. MSRV matches.
  * Deny warnings. Clippy pedantic where feasible.
  * No `unwrap` or `expect` in libs. `anyhow` only in binaries.
  * Unsafe only at FFI with safety docs.
  * Prefer const generics and `const fn` when they reduce runtime cost and encode constraints.

* Errors:

  * Libraries use typed errors via `utils::error::Result`.
  * Clear, actionable messages. No swallowing.

* Logging:

  * Structured via `utils::logger`. Proper levels. No `println!` in libs.

* Configuration:

  * `utils::app_config::AppConfig` as single source.
  * File, env, CLI sources. Secure defaults in `resources/default_config.toml`.

* CLI rules:

  * Subcommands in `cli/src/cmds`. Implement `run()`. Clap derives. Rich `--help`. Shell completions supported.

* Template system:

  * `.tmpl` files. Organized under `templates/`.
  * YAML frontmatter keys: `to`, `vars`, `rdf`, `sparql`, `determinism`.
  * Multi-language targets supported.

* RDF and queries:

  * RDF/JSON-LD as semantic source of truth.
  * SPARQL for var extraction. Prefer compile-time checked builders.
  * Validate graphs and templates before generation.
  * Deterministic transformation given seed + inputs.

* Advanced Rust for generation:

  * Use proc-macros where compile-time wins exist.
  * Const generics for template param shapes.
  * Build scripts for heavy precompute.
  * Type-level encodings prevent invalid states.

* Performance tactics:

  * Stream large graphs. Avoid whole-graph loads.
  * Cache repeated query and template steps.
  * Minimize deps. Enable LTO in release.
  * Profile hot paths. Optimize allocations.

* Security:

  * Validate all inputs. Sanitize paths. Deny traversal.
  * Sandbox template execution. No arbitrary code eval.
  * Audit log security events.

* Testing strategy:

  * Unit tests colocated. Integration tests in `/tests`.
  * Property tests with proptest for parsers, RDF, templating.
  * Compile-time assertions for constants and type constraints.
  * Deterministic snapshots via `insta`.
  * Single-threaded async tests `--test-threads=1`.
  * Fixed seeds. Mock FS, network, time.
  * Run `--release`, `--debug`, and feature variants.

* Determinism:

  * Same inputs → identical bytes. Snapshots guard regressions.

* CI/CD:

  * `cargo make fmt`, `cargo make lint`, `cargo make test`, `cargo make release`.
  * Matrix over supported Rust versions.
  * Performance checks against SLOs.
  * Completion generation validated.

* PR checklist:

  * What changed and why. Link spec or issue.
  * Perf impact. Tests added. Docs updated.
  * Backward compatibility considered.

* IDE and DX:

  * Rust-analyzer friendly. Rich error lenses.
  * Completions for template vars and SPARQL builders.
  * Live preview of generated code. Source maps for debugging.

* Must not:

  * No new top-level files or renames without docs + CI.
  * No TODOs or placeholders in libs.
  * No hardcoded outputs in prod paths.
  * No cfg mazes. Prefer explicit features.
  * No swallowing errors. No compromise on type safety.

* Definition of done:

  * Compiles. Clippy clean. Tests deterministic and passing.
  * Behavior covered by unit, integration, property tests.
  * Clear errors. Meets SLOs. Docs and examples updated.
  * Cross-platform validated. No placeholders.
  * Drop-in compatible. Outputs deterministic. RDF validated.

* Metaphors to prime:

  * Templates are blueprints. RDF graph is the single ledger.
  * Type system is the contract. Compiler is the auditor.
  * Determinism is a checksum across the pipeline.
  * Workspace is an orchestra with `core` as conductor and `cli` as stagehand.
