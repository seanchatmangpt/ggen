Description: Ontology-driven code generation CLI (v6.0.0)
 ggen is a language-agnostic, deterministic code generation tool that transforms
 RDF ontologies into reproducible code through SPARQL queries and Tera templates.
 Specification-first development using RDF/Turtle as the source of truth.
 .
 Core Features:
  - RDF-first approach using Turtle ontologies (source of truth)
  - Deterministic code generation (same input always produces identical output)
  - Five-stage deterministic pipeline (μ₁-μ₅): Normalize → Extract → Emit → Canonicalize → Receipt
  - SPARQL 1.1 query execution with OWL inference
  - Multi-pass Tera template rendering with SPARQL result injection
  - Unified 'ggen sync' command for specification → code generation
  - Watch mode for continuous regeneration during development
  - SHACL validation gates for specification closure
  - Cryptographic audit trails and deterministic receipts
  - JSON-based configuration and manifest support
 .
 Perfect for:
  - Microservices API generation (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation)
  - Multi-language code generation (Rust, Go, TypeScript, Python, Java)
  - Domain-driven design with ontology-first thinking
  - Knowledge graph-based application development
  - Deterministic workflow automation
 .
 Requirements: Rust toolchain (optional for cargo install method)
 Web Version: Install via 'cargo install ggen' in Claude Code Web
