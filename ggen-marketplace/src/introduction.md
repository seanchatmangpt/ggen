# Ggen Marketplace

Welcome to the **Ggen Marketplace** documentation! This is a production-ready Rust library for decentralized package management that provides a trait-based, extensible architecture for package discovery, distribution, and verification.

## What is Ggen Marketplace?

Ggen Marketplace is a standalone Rust library that enables:

- **Decentralized Package Management**: Discover and distribute packages across multiple registries
- **Trait-Based Architecture**: Extensible design allowing custom implementations
- **High Performance**: Built on tokio for async-first operations
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time error prevention
- **Plugin Architecture**: Feature flags and dynamic loading for optional components

## Key Features

### 🔍 **Advanced Search**
- Full-text search with Tantivy engine
- Faceted filtering by category, language, and license
- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Relevance ranking based on popularity and quality

### 🏗️ **Extensible Architecture**
- Trait-based design for maximum flexibility
- Multiple backend implementations (SQLite, PostgreSQL, S3, IPFS)
- Plugin system for custom functionality
- Zero-copy optimizations for performance

### 🔒 **Security & Verification**
- Cryptographic package verification
- Content-addressed storage with CID support
- Audit logging and security events
- Sandboxed template execution

### ⚡ **Performance**
- Async-first design with tokio
- Smart caching with moka
- Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
- Memory-efficient operations

## Quick Start

Add ggen-marketplace to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ggen-marketplace = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }
```

Basic usage:

```rust
use ggen_marketplace::{MarketplaceClient, MarketplaceBuilder};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a marketplace client
    let client = MarketplaceBuilder::new()
        .with_local_registry("./registry")
        .with_file_store("./packages")
        .build()
        .await?;

    // Search for packages
    let results = client.search("rust web framework").await?;
    
    // Install a package
    client.install("advanced-rust-api-8020").await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```
