note over User, Background
  **Performance SLOs:**
  • Search latency: <10ms (95th percentile)
  • Package download: >100MB/s
  • Cache hit ratio: >90%
  • P2P sync time: <30s for 1000 packages
  • Memory usage: <100MB per 10k packages
  • CPU usage: <50% during normal operations
  
  **Optimization Techniques:**
  • Multi-level caching (L1: memory, L2: disk)
  • Connection pooling for databases
  • Streaming for large files
  • Parallel processing for multiple operations
  • Background optimization tasks
  • Zero-copy operations where possible
  • Smart indexing and query optimization
