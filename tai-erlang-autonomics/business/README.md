## Key Findings Summary

### Market Opportunity: $170-200 Billion TAM

**Four Core Segments**:

1. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: $25.89B (2026)
   - Okta's $6-17/user/month pricing misaligned with security outcomes
   - Our model: Charge on authentication quality, fraud prevention

2. **Observability & Monitoring**: $34.1B (2026), 19.7% CAGR
   - Datadog's $0.10-1.70/GB pricing disincentivizes efficiency
   - Customer pain: 600 GB/day = $1M+/year with no ROI clarity
   - Our model: Charge on incident detection accuracy, cost savings

3. **Compliance & Governance**: $10-15B
   - FINRA, SEC, HIPAA enforcement increasing
   - Our model: Charge on audit pass rate, remediation time

4. **Workflow Automation**: $23.89B (2026), 9.5%-21.5% CAGR
   - Enterprise segment dominates (71.87% of revenue)
   - Our model: Measure cycle time, error reduction, FTE savings

### Incumbent Vulnerabilities

| Incumbent | Current Model | Vulnerability | Our Advantage |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Okta** | $6-17/user/month | No outcome accountability | Auth quality, fraud prevention |
| **Datadog** | $0.10-1.70/GB | Disincentivizes efficiency | Incident accuracy, cost savings |
| **Splunk** | $150-300/GB/day | Budget unpredictability | Threat detection rate, MTTD |
| **HashiCorp** | $0.50/secret or $150K+ | Hidden complexity | Compliance outcomes |
| **CrowdStrike** | $60-185/endpoint/year | Endpoint count ≠ detection quality | Breach prevention rate |

**Key Insight**: Incumbents are TRAPPED. They cannot shift to outcome-based pricing without cannibalizing their existing multi-billion-dollar revenue bases.

### Proven Success Stories

**Riskified (Fraud Prevention)** - GOLD STANDARD
- Model: Charge 0.4% of legitimate transaction value
- Ring case: Prevented $4M+ abusive return fraud (7 months)
- Why it works: Outcome is measurable, directly valuable, objectively verified

**Other Proven Models**:
- Zendesk: 30% customer satisfaction increase
- Intercom Fin: $0.99 per solved ticket
- ServiceNow: Outcome-based pilots with enterprise customers

**Industry Metrics**:
- 76% of enterprise customers discussing outcomes with vendors
- 21% higher satisfaction with outcome-based pricing
- 70% of insurance SaaS using hybrid outcome models
- 78% of 5+ year SaaS companies successfully implement outcome pricing

### Regulatory Validation

- **FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation)**: Explicitly promotes Performance-Based Service Acquisition
- **CMS**: Value-based care programs established and growing
- **FINRA**: 2026 priorities emphasize outcome-based compliance automation
- **Healthcare**: Pharma value-based contracts growing with regulatory support

**Conclusion**: Regulatory environment SUPPORTS outcome-based models.

### Financial Projections

| Year | Customers | ARR | Growth |
|------|-----------|-----|--------|
| 1 | 25 | $1-2M | Baseline |
| 2 | 75 | $5-10M | 200-400% |

| 4 | 400 | $50-100M | 150-200% |
| 5 | 750 | $150-300M | 150-200% |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Outcome measurement | MEDIUM | Objective metrics, hybrid pricing, 3rd-party verification |
| Customer acceptance | LOW-MEDIUM | Early adopters, proof points, education |
| Incumbent competition | MEDIUM | Vertical focus, speed, customer lock-in |
| Regulatory challenge | LOW | FAR/CMS/FINRA support existing model |
| Integration complexity | MEDIUM | API-first, partner integrators, customer success |
| Execution capability | HIGH | Experienced team, advisory board |

### Success Probability

- **Base case (60%)**: $1-5M ARR by month 18, $50-100M by year 4
- **Optimistic (20%)**: $5-10M ARR by month 12, $300M+ by year 5
