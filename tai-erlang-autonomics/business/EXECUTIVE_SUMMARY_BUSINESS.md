# TAI Erlang Autonomics - Business Model Executive Summary

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** January 25, 2026
**Audience:** Investors, Board, Leadership Team

---

## One-Page Overview

**TAI** = autonomous inventory + supply chain management platform that automatically optimizes SKU movement, pricing, and margin realization using value-indexed governance.

**Why Now?**
- $50B+ TAM in e-commerce inventory management alone
- Manual inventory coordination costs: 3-5% of GMV
- Margin leakage: $10-50M+ for mid-market retailers
- No production-grade autonomic solution exists today

**Our Technology:**
- Erlang/OTP battle-tested runtime (telecom, financial trading)
- Real-time event streaming (Pub/Sub)
- Cryptographic audit ledger (compliance-ready)
- Self-healing governors (autonomous decision-making)

**Unit Economics (Exceptional):**
- **Gross Margin:** 98.8%
- **CAC Payback:** 10 months
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** 88x (best-in-class SaaS = 3-5x)
- **Net Margin:** 76% at scale

**Financial Projection (Base Case, 3-Year):**
- **Year 1:** $450K revenue, 15 customers, -$215K net (investment phase)
- **Year 2:** $1.3M revenue, 60 customers, +$383K net (breakeven + profitable)
- **Year 3:** $2.4M revenue, 112 customers, +1.2M net (scaling)

**Funding Required:**
- **Seed:** $500K (validate PMF, acquire first 15 customers)
- **Series A:** $1.5-2.5M (scale to 50+ customers, build sales team)

**Path to Exit (Realistic Outcomes):**
- **Year 3:** $2.4M ARR (8-10x multiple = $19-24M exit)
- **Year 4:** $5M+ ARR (10-12x multiple = $50-60M exit potential)

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR >110%)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC <$8K)
- Sales Cycle Length (<60 days)
- Unit Economics (LTV/CAC >50x)

---

### 2. Massive TAM with Clear Go-to-Market

**Addressable Market:**
- **E-commerce Inventory Mgmt:** $20B TAM (500K+ SMB companies)
- **3PL/Logistics:** $15B TAM (5K+ logistics companies)
- **Healthcare Supply Chains:** $10B TAM (5K+ hospitals/networks)
- **Marketplace Aggregation:** $5B TAM (enterprise marketplaces)
- **Total TAM:** $50B+

**Market Dynamics:**
- Pain: Manual inventory coordination = 3-5% of GMV cost
- Current Solution: Expensive consultants ($500K+ per implementation)
- Opportunity: Our solution = 90% cheaper, 10x faster deployment

**Go-to-Market:**
- **Phase 1 (Y1):** Direct sales to DTC e-commerce + mid-market 3PLs (15 customers)
- **Phase 2 (Y2):** Marketplace aggregators + enterprise retailers (25+ new customers)
- **Phase 3 (Y3):** International expansion + vertical-specific solutions

---

### 3. Defensible Technology Moat

**Defensibility Layers:**

1. **Network Effects:** Each customer's data improves ML models for all customers
   - Proprietary demand forecasting engine
   - Unique margin optimization patterns
   - Predictive overstock detection

2. **Data Moat:** Cryptographic receipt ledger is unique
   - Immutable audit trail (compliance defensibility)
   - Non-repudiation for financial transactions
   - Regulatory lock-in (HIPAA, SOX compliance)

3. **Integration Depth:** Deep Pub/Sub + event architecture
   - Hard to replicate without rebuilding entire stack
   - Customer switching costs: high (event schema lock-in)
   - Integration velocity: enables rapid feature additions

4. **Operational Leverage:** Platform architecture (not services)
   - 98% gross margin vs consulting (40-50%)
   - Scales without headcount
   - Compounding advantage over time

### 4. Path to Profitability (Profitable by Month 18)

**Key Milestones:**

| Milestone | Timing | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Pre-Seed ($500K)** | Month 0 | Fund product + first 3 customers |
| **Product-Market Fit** | Month 9 | 15+ customers, 90%+ retention |
| **Profitability** | Month 18 | Positive net income |
| **Seed Follow-On ($1.5M)** | Month 15 | Scale sales team to 50 customers |
| **Series A Ready** | Month 24 | $2.4M ARR, 60+ customers |

**Why Profitable Early?**
- Software margins (98%) + immediate cash collection
- Low CAC ($3.5K) + long LTV ($775K)
- Minimal OpEx (3.5 FTE Year 1)

---

### 5. Large Enterprise Customers = Exceptional Outcomes

**Enterprise Tier Unit Economics:**

```
Customer: $80M/month GMV retailer

With TAI:
- Margin improvement: +2% = $1.6M/year in incremental revenue
- Operational savings: $1.5M/year (smaller analytics team)
- Inventory optimization: $4M freed from buffer stock
- Total value: $7.1M/year

TAI Cost: $900K/year
Participation: 2% of gains = $384K/year
Total TAI revenue: $1.3M/year

Customer LTV: $7.8M (assuming 6-year relationship)
TAI Portion: $1.3M × 6 years = $7.8M
Return on Acquisition: 2,240% 🚀
```

**Implications:**
- Each Enterprise customer = multi-million dollar relationship
- Portfolio of 5 Enterprise customers = $7.8M ARR
- 10 Enterprise customers = $15.6M ARR (Series B/C exit territory)

---

### 6. Team & Execution Capability

**Founding Team Competencies:**

| Role | Background | Track Record |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Founder/CEO** | TBD | 10+ years software infrastructure |
| **Co-Founder/CTO** | Erlang/OTP expert | Built production systems at telecom |
| **VP Sales** | Enterprise SaaS | $100M+ deal flow experience |

**Execution Plan:**
- Month 1-3: Finalize product, acquire first customer
