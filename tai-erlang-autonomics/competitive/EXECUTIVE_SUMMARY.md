# Value-Indexed Infrastructure: Executive Summary & Decision Brief

**Prepared for**: Board of Directors / Investment Committee
**Date**: January 25, 2026
**Prepared by**: Competitive Analysis & Strategic Planning
**Classification**: Strategic - Internal Use Only

## TL;DR - The Bottom Line

**Autonomic Systems is positioned to create and dominate a new $25-40B market category (outcome-indexed infrastructure) by 2031.**

The opportunity exists because:
1. **Incumbents (Okta, Datadog, Splunk) have fundamentally misaligned business models** - they profit when you use more, we profit when you achieve outcomes
2. **Incumbents cannot pivot** - doing so would destroy 30-50% of their revenue and trigger investor revolt
3. **Market forces converge in our favor** - regulatory mandates (healthcare, finance), customer price fatigue, AI enablement, and generational buyer shifts all support outcome-indexed pricing
4. **We have a 3-5 year window** to establish regulatory credibility, build customer lock-in (outcome history), and create ecosystem moat before incumbents respond

**Investment Thesis**: Fund aggressively. This is the "SaaS pricing revolution" opportunity. Winners will be $1-5B companies. Losers will see 40-70% market share erosion.

## Why This Opportunity Exists (The Core Insight)

### The Incumbent Trap

Enterprise software vendors built their business models around **unit-based consumption**:

- **Okta**: $6-17/user/month (regardless of authentication quality)
- **Datadog**: $0.10-1.70/GB/day (regardless of signal quality)
- **Splunk**: $600-1,200/GB/day (regardless of compliance value)
- **HashiCorp**: $150K+/cluster/year (regardless of secret efficiency)
- **PagerDuty**: $9-40/user/month (regardless of incident prevention)

**This creates inverse incentives**:
- Vendor succeeds when you **use more** (hire more, collect more data, rotate more secrets)
- Customer succeeds when they **use less** (fewer incidents, less data, efficient operations)
- **Result**: Misaligned incentives. Customers pay more as efficiency improves (the opposite of rational pricing)

### Why Incumbents Cannot Pivot

If Okta pivoted to outcome-indexed pricing:
- Current model: 5,000-person company pays $600K/year
- Outcome-indexed model: Same company pays $400K/year (for "compliance audit passes")
- **Math**: 33% revenue reduction = stock crash 40-60% = executive team fired

**Same story for each incumbent**:
- Datadog: Would compress margins 50% (incompatible with profitability)
- Splunk: Would make revenue unpredictable (public market cannot accept)
- HashiCorp: Would lose 92% of revenue (mathematically impossible)
- PagerDuty: Would create revenue volatility (investors demand predictability)

**Conclusion**: Incumbent inaction is rational. They are trapped by their business models.

### Why Market Shift is Inevitable

Five converging forces make outcome-indexed pricing inevitable:

**1. Regulatory Explosion** ($50-70B exposed)
- Healthcare: CMS value-based care mandate by 2028
- Finance: SEC/FINRA pushing outcome-based compliance measurement
- Privacy: GDPR, HIPAA, state privacy laws enforcement

**Signal**: Customers must "prove ROI to regulators" → Unit-based pricing cannot meet requirement

**2. Post-SaaS Fatigue** ($70-100B at risk)
- Okta: 30-50% price increase (2024-2025)
- Datadog: 25% per-GB increase (2024)
- Splunk: Customers openly hostile (G2 rating: 5/10)

**Signal**: Customers rebelling against "pay more for same value" model

**3. AI Enablement** (Makes outcome measurement practical)
- LLMs can auto-generate outcome definitions from regulatory docs (2 hours vs. 50 hours)
- AI can classify compliance/non-compliance in logs automatically
- Outcome measurement cost drops 70-80%

**Signal**: Outcome measurement becomes economically viable at $100K+ ARR deal size

**4. Ecosystem Maturity** (Makes outcome measurement interoperable)
- OpenID Connect standardizing authentication outcomes
- OpenMetrics standardizing observability outcomes
- Cloud marketplaces supporting outcome-based pricing

**Signal**: Outcomes can be measured independently, not vendor-locked

**5. Buyer Demographic Shift** (Younger CFOs demanding transparency)
- Previous CFOs: Risk-averse, "buy market leader"
- Current CFOs: Data-driven, "show me the ROI"

**Signal**: Transparency becomes purchasing requirement

**Bottom line**: These five forces are not temporary. They are structural, permanent, and accelerating.

## Competitive Landscape: Why We Win

### The Big Five Vulnerabilities

| Incumbent | Vulnerability | Impact | Can They Defend? |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Okta** | Per-user pricing encourages poor UX; seat count declining | Revenue growth plateauing | NO - would need 30% price increase to offset churn |
| **Datadog** | Per-GB pricing incentivizes data quantity over quality | Customers optimize for data reduction | NO - would need 50% margin compression to pivot |
| **Splunk** | Highest per-unit cost; customers actively switching to Datadog | Already losing market share | NO - public company cannot reduce predictable revenue |
| **HashiCorp** | Opaque cluster-based pricing; customers don't know true cost | Customer confusion = churn risk | NO - would lose 92% revenue if outcome-indexed |
| **PagerDuty** | Profits from incidents; incentives misaligned with prevention | Customers self-correcting (automation reducing on-call) | NO - outcome model creates revenue unpredictability |

### Our Defensibility (The Moat)

**Layer 1: Regulatory Approval** (Hard to change once established)
- Get Big Four (Deloitte, EY, PWC, KPMG) to approve our outcome definitions
- Once auditors approve our methodology, they won't easily change to competitor's methodology
- **Duration**: 18-24 months for competitor to replicate

**Layer 2: Outcome History** (Gets stronger with time)
- After 24 months, customer has documented 24 months of outcome improvements
- Switching to competitor means losing that proof
- Auditors trust 24-month historical data more than competitor's "promise"
- **Duration**: 24+ months (improves over time)

**Layer 3: Switching Cost Mismatch** (Regulatory + historical)
- Per-unit pricing switching cost: Implementation time + training (~$50-100K)
- Outcome-indexed switching cost: Loss of historical proof + regulatory re-approval (~$500K+)
- **Duration**: Increases over time as customer accumulates outcome history

**Bottom line**: Our moat is not technology or patents. It's regulatory approval + customer data + switching cost. Much harder to copy than features.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Regulatory Rejection (Probability: 30%)
**Risk**: Healthcare/finance regulators reject outcome-indexed as "too risky"

**Mitigation**:
- Get Big Four buy-in EARLY (before regulators form opinions)
- Partner with regulatory bodies (CMS, SEC) on frameworks
- Build non-profit standards body (harder to reject open-source standard)

### Risk 2: Incumbent Aggressive Response (Probability: 70%)
**Risk**: Okta/Datadog cut prices 50%, launch aggressive marketing

**Mitigation**:
- Lock in customers on multi-year contracts (switching cost high)
- Build outcome-improvement flywheel (switching cost increases over time)
- Partner with ecosystem (become the platform, not just alternative)

### Risk 3: Longer Sales Cycle (Probability: 60%)
**Risk**: Takes 18+ months to close first customer instead of 6 months

**Mitigation**:
- Raise 24-month runway from day 1 (not 12 months)
- Offer POC deals at $50-100K (lower friction than enterprise commitments)
- Build self-serve outcome dashboard (shorten evaluation cycle)

### Risk 4: Outcome Definition Complexity (Probability: 50%)
**Risk**: Customers say "we can't define our outcomes"

**Mitigation**:
- Ship pre-built outcome templates (don't make customers define from scratch)
- Use LLM-assisted outcome definition (reduce 50-hour effort to 2-5 hours)
- Offer consulting services (absorb complexity in early deals)

### Risk 5: Market Shift Timing (Probability: 50%)
**Risk**: Market shift happens 2-3 years later than forecast (2029-2032 vs. 2026-2029)

**Mitigation**:
- Plan for 18-month first customer (not 6-month)
- Raise aggressive capital (24-month runway minimum)
- Diversify go-to-market (don't bet all on single regulatory catalyst)

## Decision Framework for Board

### Question 1: Do You Believe in the Five Forces?

**The five forces driving market shift**:
1. Regulatory explosion (CMS, SEC/FINRA)
2. Post-SaaS fatigue (customer price rebellion)
3. AI enablement (LLMs making measurement feasible)
4. Ecosystem maturity (standards, marketplaces)
5. Buyer demographic shift (younger CFOs)

**Your decision**:
- If YES to 4-5: This is real. Fund aggressively.
- If YES to 2-3: Possible but uncertain. Fund carefully.
- If YES to 0-1: Unlikely. Don't fund.

### Question 2: Do You Believe Incumbent Lock-In is Real?

**The lock-in trap**:
- Okta: Would lose 30% revenue if outcome-indexed
- Datadog: Would compress margins 50%
- Splunk: Would make revenue unpredictable
- HashiCorp: Would lose 92% revenue
- PagerDuty: Would create revenue volatility

**Your decision**:
- If YES: Incumbents are trapped. We get 3-5 year window to build moat.
- If NO: Incumbents will copy us in 12-18 months. We don't win.

### Question 3: Do You Believe We Can Execute?

**Our execution plan**:
- 2026: Regulatory approval + 3-5 healthcare customers
- 2027: Expand to finance/enterprise + $10-20M ARR
- 2028: Inflection point + category recognition
- 2029: Market leadership + $200-300M ARR

**Your decision**:
- If YES: Fund $10-20M Series A. This is a $1-5B opportunity.
- If NO: Don't fund. Execution risk too high.
