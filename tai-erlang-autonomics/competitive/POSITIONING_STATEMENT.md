# Value-Indexed Infrastructure: Positioning Statement

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: January 25, 2026
**Audience**: Investors, board, management team, go-to-market

---

## Executive Positioning

### The One-Liner

**For enterprise infrastructure leaders managing compliance and incident response budgets,**
**Autonomic Systems delivers outcome-indexed infrastructure that charges based on customer success metrics (compliance passes, incident prevention, deployment velocity), not unit consumption (seats, GB, clusters)—ensuring vendor and customer succeed together.**

---

## The Positioning Canvas

### Target Customer

**Primary**: Healthcare systems, health plans, and insurance companies facing Medicare/Medicaid compliance mandates + security incident costs

**Secondary**: Financial services firms (banking, payments) facing SEC/FINRA compliance mandates + fraud detection requirements

**Tertiary**: Large enterprises (200+ employees) spending $500K+/year on infrastructure with opaque ROI

### Customer Problem (Stated vs. Actual)

**What they say**:
- "Our infrastructure costs are out of control"
- "We can't measure ROI on our SaaS platforms"
- "Auditors question our tool choices"

**What they actually care about**:
- Compliance audit pass/fail (not compliance tool cost)
- Incident prevention count (not incident management tool cost)
- Deployment velocity improvement (not observability tool cost)
- Budget justification to CFO (auditor says "measure your outcomes")

### Our Unique Value Proposition

**The Promise**: "You only pay for infrastructure that achieves the outcomes you care about, with cryptographic proof of measurement accuracy."

**The Core Insight**: Infrastructure vendors benefit when you *increase usage* (more seats, more data ingestion). We benefit when you *improve outcomes* (fewer incidents, faster deployments, compliance passes). Our success is literally your cost reduction.

### Competitive Differentiation

| Dimension | Okta/Datadog/Splunk | Traditional Outcome Models | Autonomic Systems |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Pricing alignment** | Vendor benefit from usage growth | Requires customer self-reporting | Vendor benefits from customer outcome improvement |
| **Measurement trust** | Vendor self-report (audit trail) | Customer self-report (manual audit) | Cryptographic proof (deterministic receipts) |
| **Switching cost** | Implementation cost | Education cost | Outcome history + regulatory approval |
| **Regulatory acceptance** | Accounting convention only | Manual audit trail | Cryptographic proof = auditor-approved |
| **Scale of adoption** | Incumbents at $1-30B scale | Startups at <$500M scale | Platform-grade at $10M-$1B+ scale |

### Category Strategy

**Category we own**: Outcome-Indexed Infrastructure (not "observability," "identity," or "compliance")

**Why this category is different**:
1. **Aligns vendor/customer incentives** (vs. traditional SaaS incentive misalignment)
2. **Uses cryptographic proof** (vs. manual outcome reporting)
3. **Works across infrastructure domains** (identity, observability, compliance, incident management)
4. **Regulatory-approved** (vs. accounting convention only)

**Why we can own this category**:
- First mover with complete solution (not point solution like Riskified)
- Platform-grade scalability (vs. healthcare-only like outcome-based care)
- Deterministic receipts (vs. vendor self-report)

## The Positioning Story (Narrative)

### Act 1: The Problem (The Status Quo)

**Setup**: Enterprise software vendors built their business models in the 2010s around unit-based consumption.

- Okta: $6-17/user/month (regardless of authentication quality)
- Datadog: $0.10-1.70/GB (regardless of signal quality)
- Splunk: $600-1,200/GB (regardless of compliance value)
- HashiCorp: $150K+/cluster (regardless of secret management efficiency)
- PagerDuty: $9-40/user (regardless of incident prevention)

**Consequence**: Vendors succeed when you *use more*. You succeed when you *use less*. Misaligned incentives.

**Customer impact**:
- A 5,000-person company paying Okta $360K-1M+/year for authentication
- A healthcare system paying Splunk $2M+/year for audit logs
- A financial services firm paying Datadog $1M+/year with no idea of ROI
- Auditors asking: "How do you measure the value of this tool?"
- Customers responding: "We don't."

**The problem intensifies**: Post-SaaS pricing fatigue. Okta 30%+ price increases. Datadog 25%+ per-GB increases. Splunk customers openly hostile.

### Act 2: The Realization (The Opportunity)

**Insight**: What if vendors were paid based on *your* success metrics, not their usage metrics?

**Precedent exists**:
- **Riskified** (fraud prevention): Charge 0.4%-0.6% of fraud prevented → $300M+ ARR
- **Intercom** (customer support): Base + per-resolved-ticket → $150M+ ARR
- **Healthcare value-based care**: Payers align with providers on health outcomes

**Question**: Why doesn't this exist for infrastructure?

**Answer**: Because incumbents can't afford to. Their entire business model is built on unit-based consumption. Reengineering would:
1. Destroy public company valuation (investors hate outcome-based revenue models)
2. Break sales compensation (all reps paid on ARR, not on customer outcomes)
3. Require auditor re-approval (ASC 606 revenue recognition nightmare)
4. Flip their moat upside-down (efficient customers become unprofitable)

**Our advantage**: Clean slate. No legacy revenue model. No sales org to retrain. We can start fresh.

### Act 3: The Solution (Autonomic Systems)

**What we built**: Outcome-indexed infrastructure where pricing is indexed to *your* success metrics.

**How it works**:

1. **You define outcomes** (with our help):
   - Healthcare: "Compliance audit pass on Q4 2026"
   - Finance: "30% reduction in fraud-related incidents"
   - Enterprise: "90%+ deployment success rate"

2. **We measure continuously** (with cryptographic proof):
   - Real-time dashboard showing outcome progress
   - Deterministic receipts proving measurement accuracy
   - Immutable audit trail for regulatory approval

3. **You pay for outcomes achieved**:
   - Compliance pass = contracted price
   - Compliance fail = no charge (or reduced charge)
   - Incident prevention metrics = tiered pricing based on performance

4. **Both parties succeed together**:
   - We're paid when you achieve your goals
   - You're charged based on value delivered
   - Incentives are aligned

**The proof**: Deterministic receipts (cryptographic proof) instead of vendor self-reports.
- Built on RDF ontology (regulatory-approved outcome definitions)
- Generated by deterministic pipeline (no human judgment)
- Immutable (auditors can verify independently)

### Act 4: The Implications (The New World)

**For you** (the customer):
- Pricing transparency: You know exactly what you're paying for
- Budget justification: Board sees "outcomes achieved, payment owed"
- Audit confidence: Auditors see cryptographic proof (not vendor claims)
- Risk reduction: Vendor succeeds when you succeed
- Cost alignment: If you optimize for efficiency, costs decrease (not increase)

**For the category** (the market):
- Alignment of incentives across enterprise infrastructure
- Outcome-based pricing becomes standard (not exception)
- Auditors approve cryptographic measurement (regulatory shift)
- Customers demand outcome metrics from all vendors (competitive shift)

## Sales Positioning Cheat Sheet

### Discovery Call Opening (5 min)

> "Thanks for taking the time. I want to understand your infrastructure spending.
>
> Quick question: Of your $5M infrastructure budget, how much is you actually seeing ROI on? Like, your board asks: Did this tool save us money? Can you prove it?"

[Listen for: "No idea," "Probably 30%," "Don't have visibility."]

### Problem Reframing (10 min)

> "You're not alone. Most infrastructure teams can't measure ROI because vendors price based on usage, not outcomes.
>
> Okta charges per-user, regardless of authentication quality.
> Datadog charges per-GB, regardless of signal quality.
> Splunk charges per-GB, regardless of compliance value.
>
> What if we flipped it? What if vendors were paid based on *your* success metrics, not their usage metrics?"

### Solution Positioning (5 min)

> "That's what outcome-indexed pricing does. You define your outcome (compliance audit pass, incident prevention, deployment velocity). We measure it with cryptographic proof. You pay based on what you achieve.
>
> It's similar to how Riskified charges for fraud prevention, or how healthcare providers charge for patient outcomes.
>
> The difference: We use cryptographic receipts so auditors can verify measurements independently."

### Close / Next Steps

> "Does this align with how you want to think about infrastructure spending?"

[If yes]: "Great. Let's run a POC. 90 days, zero risk. We'll prove the model works for your situation."

[If no]: "Understood. But if your board ever asks 'what's the ROI on this tool?'—come back to us."

---

## Final Positioning Statement

### For the Board

Autonomic Systems owns a new category: **outcome-indexed infrastructure**. We charge customers based on the business outcomes they achieve (compliance passes, incident prevention, deployment velocity), not on infrastructure consumption (seats, GB, clusters). This creates alignment between vendor and customer success that is mathematically impossible for incumbents (Okta, Datadog, Splunk) to match without destroying their business models.

Our defensibility comes from three layers:
1. **Regulatory approval** (healthcare/finance compliance frameworks)
2. **Customer outcome history** (24+ months of documented improvements, cryptographic proof)
3. **Category ownership** (first mover in outcome-indexed infrastructure)

Timeline to revenue leadership: 3-5 years; realistic exit: $1-3B acquisition or IPO.
