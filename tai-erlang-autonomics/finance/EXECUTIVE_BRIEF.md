## Appendix: Common Questions

**Q: What if we don't hit the customer acquisition targets?**
A: Even at -30% (2 customers/month instead of 1.25), we hit breakeven Month 18 and $2.8M profit by Year 3. Pre-seed runway still sufficient with Seed capital.

**Q: What's the CAC payback if sales cycles are longer?**
A: At 90-day cycles: payback extends to 2.4 months (still <3 months). Unit economics remain healthy.

**Q: How much cash does Series A really need?**
A: $4-6M enables 24-36 months of runway. $5M recommended (middle of range). Could do less in optimistic scenario, more in conservative.

**Q: What happens if churn goes to 3%?**
A: Breakeven extends to Month 20-22. Still achievable, but tighter. Focus on retention from day 1.

**Q: When should we hire the VP Sales?**
A: Month 9-12 (after PMF validation). Bootstrap sales as founder first, then delegate.
