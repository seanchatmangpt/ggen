BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

This is TAI's most important deal.

Customer #1 is not a customer. Customer #1 is a **proof point** that validates
the entire business model and unlocks Series A conversations.

If we execute this playbook correctly:
├─ Customer #1 becomes a long-term $775K+ LTV customer
├─ We publish a credible, referenceable case study
├─ Customers #2-3 become easier to land (proof of concept done)
├─ Series A fundraising shifts from "promise" to "proof"
├─ Our valuation multiple improves $5-10M from validated model

If we fail with Customer #1:
├─ We learn what customer profile doesn't work
├─ We adjust targeting for Customers #2-3
├─ We still have learning worth $45K
├─ The market remains open, just different approach needed

The success probability is high (60% all metrics, 80% at least 3/3 primary).
The downside is manageable ($145K sunk cost). The upside is exceptional
($5-10M valuation lift).

This is where we place our bet.
