## Red Flags & Contingencies

**IF METRICS LAG BY WEEK 6:**
1. Diagnose root cause (TAI issue vs. customer behavior)

3. Increase TAI support investment
4. Re-evaluate success probability

**IF CUSTOMER WANTS TO CANCEL EARLY:**
1. Offer break-even pricing for Year 2 ($25K)
2. Negotiate case study + testimonial rights
3. Maintain relationship for future referrals
4. Don't burn bridge (could still be reference)

**IF RESULTS ARE POOR AT WEEK 12:**
1. Honest assessment of what failed
2. Either: Graceful exit OR pivot to lower pricing
3. Document learnings: What customer profile to avoid
4. Use as learning, not failure

## One-Page Decision Framework

**Proceed with Pilot if:**

- [ ] TAI technology is production-ready (MVP launch complete)
- [ ] Executive team committed to 12-week sprint
- [ ] $95-145K contingency budget approved
- [ ] Sales can identify 5+ target companies
- [ ] Customer Success team has capacity (1.5 FTE allocated)
- [ ] Legal can review contract template
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable with customer's data
- [ ] Board awareness/approval obtained

**Do NOT Proceed if:**

- ❌ Technology not ready for customer (too many unknowns)
- ❌ Executive team unavailable for 12-week commitment
- ❌ Budget not approved (can't overservice without approval)
- ❌ Sales pipeline insufficient (no targets identified)
- ❌ Customer Success team stretched (can't add 1.5 FTE)
- ❌ Legal concerns about contract terms
- ❌ Success metrics undefined or unmeasurable

---

## The Bottom Line

**Customer #1 is TAI's most important deal.**

This is not a sale. This is a proof point that validates the entire business model and unlocks Series A conversations.

If executed correctly:
- Customer becomes long-term $775K+ LTV customer
- Credible, referenceable case study published
- Customers #2-3 land faster (proof of concept done)
- Series A fundraising shifts from "promise" to "proof"
- Valuation improves $5-10M from validated model

The probability of success is high (60-80% with right profile).
The downside is manageable ($145K sunk cost).
The upside is exceptional ($5-10M valuation lift).

**This is where TAI places its bet.**

## Questions Before You Proceed?

**Strategic Questions:**
- "Is this the right approach to market validation?"
- "Should we target different customer profile?"
- "How does this fit with Series A narrative?"

**Operational Questions:**
- "Can we really deliver on the 12-week timeline?"
- "Do we have the resources to overservice?"
- "What's the backup plan if Customer #1 fails?"

**Financial Questions:**
- "What's the actual break-even ROI?"
- "How does this impact our runway/burn?"
- "What if Series A doesn't come?"

**All answered in the detailed documents.** Start with README.md if you have strategic questions, FIRST_CUSTOMER_PROGRAM.md if you have operational questions, SUCCESS_METRICS.md if you have measurement questions.
