KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Do Not Launch Without These):

1. SECURITY: 8 critical vulnerabilities
   - No TLS/HTTPS (data in plaintext)
   - No request authentication (anyone can POST)
   - Signature verification optional (forgeable events)
   - Incomplete JWT validation (expired tokens work)
   - No rate limiting (DDoS + brute force possible)
   - Poor input validation
   - Missing security headers
   - No audit logging
   
   Impact: Attacker can inflate customer value without authorization
   Cost to fix: $20-40K (consulting) + engineering time (4-5 weeks)
   Timeline: CRITICAL PATH

2. INSURANCE: No coverage obtained
   - E&O: $2-5M coverage ($15-40K/yr) - MISSING
   - Cyber: $1-5M coverage ($20-50K/yr) - MISSING
   - D&O: $2-5M coverage ($25-60K/yr) - MISSING
   - Crime/Fidelity: $250K-1M ($5-15K/yr) - MISSING
   
   Impact: Single security breach → company bankruptcy
   Cost: $65-200K annually
   Timeline: 4 weeks to obtain

3. CONTRACTS: No customer agreements
   - TOS: Not drafted
   - DPA: Not created
   - SLA: Not defined
   - Entitlement agreement: Missing
   
   Impact: Agreements unenforceable in court
   Cost: $10-20K legal
   Timeline: 3 weeks

4. REVENUE POLICY: No ASC 606 policy
   - When is revenue recognized? UNDEFINED
   - How is value converted to revenue? UNDEFINED
   - GL account mapping? NOT DONE
   - Auditor sign-off? NOT OBTAINED
   
   Impact: Revenue recognized incorrectly → audit failure
   Cost: $20-50K (Big 4 accounting)
   Timeline: 6 weeks

5. REGULATORY: Status unknown
   - Is SEC registration required? UNKNOWN
   - Do we need money transmitter licenses? UNKNOWN
   - State licensing requirements? UNKNOWN
   
   Impact: Operating without required license = federal crime
   Cost: $5-10K (securities counsel)
   Timeline: 2 weeks for opinion

TOTAL INVESTMENT TO FIX: $150-300K one-time + $125-330K annual

================================================================================
TIMELINE
================================================================================

WEEK 1-2: Parallel workstream startup

  - Insurance: Broker quotes
  - Engineering: Security fix planning
  - Regulatory: Securities counsel engagement

WEEK 3-4: Continue + Security fixes begin
  - All workstreams continue
  - Engineering: TLS/HTTPS + JWT implementation

WEEK 5-6: Security fixes + Insurance binding
  - Engineering: Rate limiting + input validation
  - Insurance: Binding quotes received
  - Legal: Contracts finalized

WEEK 7-8: Testing + Pre-launch
  - Engineering: All 8 security items fixed + tested
  - Operations: SLA docs, support runbooks
  - Compliance: SOC2 planning

WEEK 9-12: Go-live preparation
  - Final dry-run with willing customer
  - Launch with real revenue (Week 12)
  - SOC2 audit begins (6-month engagement parallel)

TOTAL: 8-12 weeks (cannot be compressed without taking on risk)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

STATUS: DO NOT LAUNCH WITH REAL REVENUE UNTIL ALL ITEMS COMPLETE

INVESTMENT: $150-300K one-time, $125-330K annually
TIMELINE: 8-12 weeks
RISK IF SKIPPED: Company bankruptcy (uninsured liability + lawsuit exposure)

RECOMMEND: Option A - Do It Right
- Proper security fixes
- Insurance coverage
- Customer contracts
- Revenue recognition policy
- Regulatory compliance
- Enterprise-ready infrastructure

NOT RECOMMENDED: Option B - Skip Everything
- Would save money short-term
- Exposes company to catastrophic risk
- One security breach = bankruptcy
- Customer lawsuit = undefended
- Regulatory violation = federal crime

BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

TECHNICAL FOUNDATION: STRONG
- Scalable architecture (Cloud Run)
- Real integrations (Firestore, Pub/Sub)
- Clean compilation
- No mocks or stubs

PRODUCTION READINESS: NOT READY
- 8 critical security vulnerabilities
- No insurance coverage
- No customer contracts
- Revenue policy undefined
- Regulatory status unknown

RECOMMENDATION: Invest $150-300K and 8-12 weeks to do it right
- Low one-time investment relative to risk
- Defensible legal position
- Enterprise customer confidence
- Sustainable business model

ALTERNATIVE: Skip everything and launch
- Save $150-300K short-term
- Expose company to bankruptcy risk
- Lose customer trust
- Face regulatory prosecution

We strongly recommend the first option.
