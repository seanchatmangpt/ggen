## Key Decisions Made (Non-Negotiable)

2. **Founder control through Series A**
   - 48% CEO equity, 16% CTO, 12% VP Product
   - Board control: CEO + 1 lead investor + independent director
   - No automatic investor seats until Series A

3. **Talent over politics**
   - Hire for capability + values fit (not connections)
   - Early team 4-year cliff (retention incentive)
   - Radical transparency on compensation (salary bands published)

4. **Technical excellence is non-negotiable**
   - All code reviewed by 2+ people
   - Chicago TDD mandatory (80%+ coverage minimum)
   - Security-first architecture (not retrofit)
   - No technical debt accumulation

5. **Honest communication**

## Common Questions

**Q: Why 48% founder equity if you're hiring strong people?**
A: Founder retains meaningful control through Series A (30%+). At Series B/C, dilution is proportional (all shareholders dilute equally). This structure attracts strong co-founders (CTO gets 16%) while protecting founder vision.

**Q: Why no 401k match in pre-seed?**
A: Cash preservation priority. Once Series A closes, add 3-5% match immediately. Early team is compensated through equity upside.

**Q: What if Series A is delayed past Month 20?**
A: Multiple levers: (1) Hiring pause saves $20K/month, (2) Salary reduction (temporary) saves $200K/month, (3) Marketing freeze saves $5K/month. Combined: 6-month extension possible. But best mitigation: start Series A fundraising Month 12 (not Month 18).

**Q: Should we hire a full-time CFO in pre-seed?**
A: No. Use startup accountant + finance contractor until Series A. Full-time CFO hired Month 20+ (cost ~$180K + benefits).

**Q: When do we need an HR person?**
A: Month 24 (post-Series A ramp to 25+ people). Pre-seed/Series A: founder handles recruiting + culture personally.
