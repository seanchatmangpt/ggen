# TAI Autonomics - Equity Model & Cap Table Management

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: January 25, 2026
**Classification**: Confidential - Finance & Leadership
**Audience**: Founders, Investors, Advisors, Finance/HR

---

## Executive Summary

TAI Autonomics cap table strategy optimizes for:
1. **Founder control** through Series A (51%+ common stock ownership)
2. **Early employee retention** (meaningful equity, not just options)
3. **Investor alignment** (clear, predictable dilution)
4. **Advisor incentives** (small equity for outsized value)
5. **Future scalability** (clean option pool for hiring)

**Current Target** (Pre-seed):
- Founder + core team: 92% common stock
- Pre-seed investors: 8% (SAFE notes or convertible)
- Option pool reserved: 2% (for Months 9-12 hires)

## Current Cap Table (Pre-Seed, $500K Round)

### Share Structure

**Total authorized shares**: 10,000,000 (common, no preferred class yet)

### Common Stock Allocation

| Holder | Shares | % Ownership | Vesting | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Sean Chatman (CEO)** | 4,800,000 | 48% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Founder, controls board seat |
| **CTO (TBD)** | 1,600,000 | 16% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Co-founder equivalent |
| **VP Product (TBD)** | 1,200,000 | 12% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Founding team |
| **Head of Sales (TBD)** | 800,000 | 8% | 4yr/1yr cliff | VP-track |
| **Sr Backend #2 (TBD)** | 600,000 | 6% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Platform lead |
| **Head of Compliance (M6 hire)** | 400,000 | 4% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Security + audit |
| **Head of Operations (M6 hire)** | 200,000 | 2% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Finance + ops |
| **Customer Success (M6 hire)** | 200,000 | 2% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Revenue ops |
| **Option Pool (Reserved)** | 200,000 | 2% | 4yr/1yr cliff | Months 9-12 hires |
| **TOTAL COMMON** | 10,000,000 | 100% | | |

### Pre-Seed Investment ($500K)

| Investor | Amount | Instrument | Share Price | Shares | % Post-Money |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **Lead Investor** | $250K | SAFE (MFN + Pro-rata) | (on conversion) | (on conversion) | ~3.9% |
| **Secondary Investors** | $150K | SAFE (Pro-rata) | (on conversion) | (on conversion) | ~2.3% |
| **Friends & Family** | $100K | SAFE or Convertible | (on conversion) | (on conversion) | ~1.5% |
| **TOTAL** | $500K | | | | ~7.7% aggregate |

**Notes on SAFEs**:
- SAFE = Simple Agreement for Future Equity
- No equity now, but convert to Series A at discount (typically 20% discount)
- Pro-rata rights: Can invest additional capital in Series A to maintain ownership %
- MFN = Most Favored Nation: If another investor gets better terms, they do too
- Conversion: Happens automatically at Series A or IPO, or when triggered

**Conversion Example (Series A at $50M post-money)**:
- Lead investor SAFE ($250K) converts at 20% discount
- Effective investment valuation: $50M × 0.8 = $40M
- Share price: $40M / 10M shares = $4/share
- Shares received: $250K / $4 = 62,500 shares = 0.625% post-Series A

---

## Vesting Schedule & Cliff

### Standard Vesting (All Roles)

**Vesting Formula**: 4 years / 1 year cliff

```
Year 1: 25% vest at 1-year anniversary (cliff)
Year 2: 50% vested
Year 3: 75% vested
Year 4: 100% vested

Monthly vesting: 1/48 of total per month (after cliff)
```

### Vesting Example (4,800,000 shares, CEO)

```
Month 0-11: 0 shares vested (vesting in progress)
Month 12: 1,200,000 vested (25%, cliff hit) ✓ Now owns 12%
Month 13: 1,225,000 vested (added 25,000)
...
Month 48: 4,800,000 vested (100%)
```

### Double-Trigger Acceleration (None in Seed)

**TAI Position**: No acceleration in seed round, even if acquired
- If TAI acquired for $50M pre-Series A, equity vests normally
- Founder still has runway to stay if desired
- This creates better founder/investor alignment

**Possible change at Series A**: Discuss single-trigger 50% acceleration for key executives if acquired at high multiple before Series A milestone hits

---

## Option Pool Management

### Year 1 Option Pool (Months 9-12)

**Reserved Pool Size**: 200,000 shares (2% of total cap table)

**Allocation Plan**:

| Hire | Role | Shares | % | Strike Price | Vesting |
|------|------|--------|---|--------------|---------|
| M9 | Product Manager | 50,000 | 0.5% | $0 (current FMV) | 4yr/1yr |
| M9 | Sales Dev Rep | 30,000 | 0.3% | $0 | 4yr/1yr |
| M10 | DevOps Contractor (P/T) | 20,000 | 0.2% | $0 | 3yr/1yr |
| M11-M12 | Misc/Buffer | 100,000 | 1.0% | $0 | As needed |

**Key assumptions**:
- Strike price = Fair Market Value at grant (avoiding 409A complications)
- No underwater options (keep strike price low until Series A)
- All new hires get 4yr/1yr vesting EXCEPT part-time contractors (3yr/1yr)

### Series A Option Pool (Year 2)

**Refresh plan**: At Series A, refresh option pool to 15-20% of post-Series A cap

**Trigger**: Series A financing close
**Action**: Board approves 1.5-2M additional shares for option pool (depending on size of round)
**Purpose**: Hire 10-15 more people over 18 months

---

## Series A Cap Table Projection (Month 18-24)

### Scenario: Series A at $50M post-money valuation

**Assume**: Series A raise of $12M (to support growth through Year 3)

### Series A Investment Structure

| Investor | Amount | Preferred | % Series A |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Series A Lead** | $6M | Series A Preferred | 12% |
| **Follow-ons** | $3M | Series A Preferred | 6% |
| **Prior SAFE holders** | $2M | Converts to Series A Pref | 4% |
| **Pro-rata rights** | $1M | Series A Preferred | 2% |
| **TOTAL** | $12M | | **24% Series A** |

### Post-Series A Cap Table

| Holder | Common | Preferred | Total % | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **CEO** | 48% | - | 38.4% | Diluted but still controls |
| **CTO** | 16% | - | 12.8% | Diluted proportionally |
| **VP Product** | 12% | - | 9.6% | Diluted proportionally |
| **Other founders + team** | 16% | - | 12.8% | Vested + unvested |
| **Option pool (new)** | - | - | 15%* | Series A refresh |
| **Series A investors** | - | 24% | 24% | Preferred stock |
| **SAFENOTEHOLDERS** | - | 8%* | 8% | Converted to Preferred |
| **TOTAL** | 92% | 32% | 100% | |

*Approx, depends on conversion mechanics

### Founder Ownership Through Rounds

| Round | Founder% (Pre-Dilution) | Founder% (Post-Dilution) | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Seed/Pre-seed** | 48% | 40% | ~8% dilution for $500K |
| **Series A** | 40% | 30% | ~10% dilution for $12M |
| **Series B** | 30% | 21% | ~9% dilution for $30M |
| **Series C** | 21% | 15% | ~6% dilution for $50M |

**Strategic implication**: Founder maintains meaningful control + upside through C round

---

## Preferred vs Common Stock

### Two-Class Structure (After Series A)

**Common Stock** (Founders + Employees):
- Participates in appreciation
- One vote per share
- Last in line for liquidation (upside focus)
- Example: If acquired for $100M, common holders split after preferred liquidated

**Series A Preferred Stock** (Investors):
- 1x non-participating preferred (standard terms)
- Gets full liquidation preference before common
- Converts to common at IPO
- Voting power: Typically 1 vote per share until IPO

### Conversion Rights at Exit

**Non-Participating Example** (what TAI targets):

```
Exit at $100M for company founded with $500K pre-seed + $12M Series A = $12.5M invested

Series A holder has $1M invested (8.33% preferred):
- Liquidation preference: 1x = $1M
- Conversion: Would get 8.33% of $100M = $8.33M
- TAI deal: Convert (get $8.33M > $1M), no participation

Founders (48% common of original pool):
- Exit: 48% × common ownership %
- After Series A dilution: ~30%
- Share of $100M: $30M
```

## Dilution Scenarios & Board Seat Impact

### Typical Dilution Path (Standard VC)

| Round | Raise | Pre-Money | Post-Money | Dilution | Founder% |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Pre-seed** | $500K | $5.5M | $6.0M | 8.3% | 48% → 40% |
| **Series A** | $12M | $38M | $50M | 24% | 40% → 30% |
| **Series B** | $30M | $110M | $140M | 21% | 30% → 24% |
| **Series C** | $50M | $250M | $300M | 17% | 24% → 20% |
| **IPO** | - | - | - | - | 15-20% |

### Board Composition Strategy

**Pre-seed** (1 board seat):
- Seat 1: CEO (founder)
- Lead investor gets board observation (no seat)
- Advisor gets board observation (no seat)

**Series A** (3 board seats):
- Seat 1: CEO (founder)
- Seat 2: Series A lead investor (or delegate)
- Seat 3: Independent director (bring in domain expertise)

**Series B** (5 board seats):
- Seat 1: CEO (founder)
- Seat 2: Series A lead investor
- Seat 3: Series B lead investor
- Seat 4: Independent director
- Seat 5: Independent director (or employee representative - rare)

**Board Observer Rights**:
- All subsequent investors get board observer rights
- Participate in meetings, no voting

---

## Stock Option Plans (ISO vs NSO)

### Option Grant Strategy

All employee grants target **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)** where possible:
- Tax-advantaged (no ordinary income tax on grant)
- Long-term capital gains treatment if held 2+ years
- Tax risk only on exercise (Alternative Minimum Tax for ISOs)

### Grant Details

| Component | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Strike Price** | FMV at grant | ~$0 (company early stage) |
| **Grant Type** | ISO | All employees get ISOs first |
| **Vesting Schedule** | 4yr/1yr | Standard startup |
| **Exercise Window** | 10 years | Post-termination, 90 days to exercise |
| **Acceleration** | None pre-Series A | Single-trigger at acquisition only |

### 409A Valuation

**What is it?**: Third-party valuation of company common stock for tax purposes
**When needed?**: Before first option grant (within 90 days)
**Cost**: ~$3-5K for startup valuation
**Update frequency**: Every 12 months or major financing

**Why it matters**:
- If options granted below 409A value → ordinary income tax on gain
- If options granted above 409A value → no tax issue (but bad deal for employee)
- TAI targets: 409A = current financing round valuation

**Example (Series A at $50M post-money)**:
- 10M shares outstanding
- Per-share value: $50M / 10M = $5/share
- 409A value: $5/share
- New option grant: $5/share strike price
- Employee exercises 10K shares for $50K
- If sells for $8M later: Gain = (price - $5) × shares = long-term capital gains

---

## Refresh Cycles & Cap Table Maintenance

### Annual 409A Valuation (Every January)

**Process**:
1. **October**: Finance team prepares financials, customer list, key metrics
2. **November**: Share with valuation firm (Mercury, Carta, etc.)
3. **December**: Receive 409A valuation report
4. **January**: Board approves, filed with option plan

**Cost**: ~$3-5K/year (amortize into fundraising budget)

### Semi-Annual Option Pool Reviews (Every 6 Months)

| Activity | Month | Owner | Action |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Pool audit** | M6 | Finance | Are granted options tracking plan? |
| **New grants** | As-needed | CEO | Approve new hires' grants |
| **Equity register** | M12 | Finance | Full audit + reconciliation |

### Annual Cap Table Update (Every December)

**Include**:
- All vested equity (founders)
- All option exercises (employees)
- New SAFE/preferred conversions
- Advisor equity vesting

**Owner**: Finance team with external counsel review
**Deliverable**: Updated cap table on Carta or spreadsheet

## Tax Implications

### Founder Considerations

| Event | Tax Treatment | Cost | Mitigation |
|-------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **Stock grant (vesting)** | No tax (income per month) | Ordinary rates on vesting | Immaterial at early stage |
| **Exercise (ISO options)** | AMT risk at exercise | If stock appreciates significantly | Hold 2+ years post-exercise |
| **409A step-up** | If valuation increases 25%+, catch-up | Ordinary income rate | Accept as cost of growth |
| **Exit (long-term capital gains)** | 20% federal + state taxes | 15-25% effective rate | Hold >1 year to qualify |

### Employee Option Taxation

| Scenario | Tax Event | Rate | Timing |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| **ISO exercise** | None (unless AMT applies) | - | At exercise |
| **ISO sale (>2 years)** | Long-term capital gain | 15-20% | On sale |
| **NSO exercise** | Ordinary income on spread | Ordinary rate (37%) | At exercise |
| **NSO sale** | Capital gain on appreciation | Short or long-term | On sale |

**TAI goal**: All grants are ISOs (better for employees)

---

## Anti-Dilution Provisions

### What TAI Will Accept (Founder-Friendly)

**Weighted-average anti-dilution** (most common):
- If Series A priced lower than Series B
- Series A investors' shares adjust proportionally
- Doesn't hurt founders as much as full ratchet

**Formula**:
```
New shares = Old shares × (Original price / New price)
```

**Example**:
- Series A at $10/share, investor bought 100K shares
- Series B at $7/share (down round)
- Weighted-average: 100K × (10 / 7) = 142.9K new shares (anti-dilution protection)

### What TAI Will Reject (Founder-Killing)

**Full ratchet anti-dilution**:
- If Series A at $10/share, Series B at $7/share
- Series A investors get shares at $7 (full ratchet)
- Massively dilutes founders

**Example**:
- Series A at $10/share: 100K shares
- Series B down at $7/share
- Full ratchet: 100K shares repriced to $7 (terrible for founders)
- TAI position: We reject this, prefer weighted-average

## Exit Scenarios & Founder Upside

### Acquisition Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Acquired at $100M (Year 2)**

```
Cap table at exit:
- Founder (CEO): 30% common
- Common holders (total team): 60% common
- Preferred (investors): 32% preferred (2x non-participating)

Liquidation waterfall:
1. Preferred holders: 1x preference = $12.5M invested returned first ✓
2. Remaining: $100M - $12.5M = $87.5M
3. Common holders: $87.5M × 60% = $52.5M
4. Founder (CEO): 30% × $52.5M = $15.75M ✓

Founder upside: $15.75M

If founder also invested in Series A: Add $1-2M from preferred participation
Total founder outcome: ~$17-18M
```

**Scenario 2: IPO at $1B (Year 6-7)**

```
Cap table at IPO:
- Founder: 15% common (diluted through B/C rounds)
- Team: 40% common
- Investors: 45% preferred (converts to common)

At $1B exit:
- Founder 15%: $150M ✓
- If IPO lockup expires: Can start selling at 6-month mark

Founder net after taxes (25% effective): ~$112.5M
```

### Tax Impact on Exit

**Short-term gains** (held <1 year):
- Taxed as ordinary income (up to 37%)
- Employer withholding required (typically 22-37%)
- Not pleasant

**Long-term gains** (held >1 year):
- Taxed as capital gains (15-20% federal)
- State taxes on top (0-13.3% California)
- Much better

**Founder strategy**: Hold equity >1 year before any planned exit if possible

---

## Cap Table Transparency

### Who Sees the Cap Table

**Unrestricted access**:
- CEO (always)
- CFO/Finance team (always)
- Board members (always)

**Restricted access** (by permission):
- Other employees: See option pool size + their own grant, not full cap table
- Advisors: See on NDA basis
- Investors: See current + projected (Series A assumptions)

**Why restrict?**: Avoid salary negotiations based on equity dilution levels

### Equity Transparency Policy

**What we tell employees**:
- "Your grant: X shares, vesting 4 years / 1 year cliff"
- "Company's option pool: Y% (enough for 15 more hires)"
- "Fully diluted (assuming Series A): Z million shares"
- "Your % ownership at full dilution: W%"
- "Example exit scenario: If sold at $500M, your grant worth $XXK-$YYK"

**What we don't tell everyone** (but is available on request):
- Founder equity splits (minimizes resentment)
- Investor terms (we explain philosophy, not specifics)
- Salary of other employees (see salary transparency doc)

---

## Option Plan Administration

### Key Documents Needed

1. **Stock Option Plan** (401 pages template)
   - Board approves option plan structure
   - Permits grants of up to X shares
   - Defines acceleration, termination, exercise windows

2. **Stock Purchase Agreement** (per employee)
   - Grant agreement showing options granted + vesting terms
   - Employee signs upon hire
   - Includes acceleration clauses if any

3. **409A Valuation** (annual)
   - Professional report from valuation firm
   - Establishes FMV of common stock for tax purposes

4. **Option Register** (maintained by Finance)
   - Tracks all grants, exercises, expirations
   - Reconciled annually to cap table

5. **Cap Table** (Carta or spreadsheet)
   - Master document of all equity
   - Updated after every financing, grant, or exercise

### Exercise & Cashless Exercise

**Standard exercise**: Employee pays strike price to company
- Employee writes check for (shares × strike price)
- Gets stock certificates

**Cashless exercise**: Use proceeds to cover exercise + taxes
- Employee exercises options
- Broker sells enough shares to cover exercise price + withholding
- Rest goes to employee

**TAI default**: Cashless exercise allowed (employees rarely have $50K+ lying around)

---

## Future Considerations (Series B+)

### Founder Refresh Grants

If founder still CEO at Series B (Month 30-36):
- Board may grant refresh equity (0.5-1% annually)
- Helps with retention + signals confidence
- Vests over new 4-year schedule
- Typical at this stage

### Incentive Plans (Post-IPO)

If TAI IPOs:
- Move from option grants to RSU (Restricted Stock Unit) grants
- Much simpler tax treatment for employees
- Employer tax consequence same, but cleaner for finance

## Appendix: Common Equity Questions

### Q: Why 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff?
**A**: Industry standard. Protects company (if employee leaves Year 1, equity returns to pool). Also protects employee (cliff means you own something material after 1 year).

### Q: What if I leave after 2 years?
**A**: You own 50% of your grant (2 years of 4-year vest). You have 90 days to exercise at strike price. If options are underwater, you'll exercise. If above-water, you may exercise + hold.

### Q: Can I exercise early (before vesting)?
**A**: Some plans allow "early exercise," meaning you buy shares now, they become subject to vesting (clawback if you leave). We don't offer this by default (adds complexity).

### Q: What's my equity worth?
**A**:
- At grant: $0 (strike price = FMV)
- When Series A prices shares: (Series A price - strike) × shares
- At exit: Actual sale proceeds

Example: You get 50K options at $0 strike. Series A prices at $5/share. Your options now worth $250K (paper gains). At IPO at $50/share: $2.5M (paper gains).

### Q: Can my equity be diluted away?
**A**: Yes, through future financings. But all shareholders dilute proportionally (founders + employees). The benefit: Each financing means company is worth more (Seed: $6M, Series A: $50M, Series B: $140M). Your 1% may become 0.75%, but company is worth 23x more.

### Q: What happens to my options if I leave?
**A**:
- Vested options: You own them, can exercise within 90 days (or 10 years if we allow extended exercise window)
- Unvested: Return to company option pool immediately
- Strike price: Doesn't change (you still pay original strike)

### Q: Should I exercise early?
**A**: Only if:
1. You believe company will be worth significantly more in 5+ years
2. You have cash to pay strike price + taxes (83(b) election)
3. You're comfortable with illiquid equity

Most employees don't exercise early (requires capital).
