## Part 2: Monthly Burn Projection

### Year 1 Detailed Burn (Jan - Dec 2026)

| Month | Payroll | Benefits | Infrastructure | Sales/Mkt | Legal/Comp | G&A | **Total Burn** | Cash Balance |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------------|--------------|
| M1 | $100K | $15K | $3K | $2K | $3K | $2K | **$125K** | $2,000K - $125K = **1,875K** |
| M2 | $330K | $55K | $4K | $3K | $5K | $3K | **$400K** | $1,875K - $400K = **1,475K** |
| M3 | $330K | $55K | $4K | $5K | $12K | $4K | **$410K** | $1,475K - $410K = **1,065K** |
| M4 | $290K | $48K | $5K | $4K | $2K | $3K | **$352K** | $1,065K - $352K = **713K** |
| M5 | $290K | $48K | $5K | $4K | $2K | $3K | **$352K** | $713K - $352K = **361K** |
| **M6 (After pre-seed)** | $390K | $63K | $5K | $5K | $3K | $4K | **$470K** | $361K + $500K - $470K = **$391K** |
| M7 | $430K | $68K | $6K | $8K | $3K | $5K | **$520K** | $391K - $520K = **-$129K** (need buffer) |

**Issue detected**: Without Series A close or customer revenue ramp, cash runs out Month 7-8.

**Mitigations**:
1. **Customer revenue comes in**: Target $5-10K MRR by Month 6 (helps bridge)
2. **Restrict hiring**: Don't hire Sales Dev Rep until customer revenue confirmed
3. **Extend pre-seed timeline**: Seek additional $300-500K if Series A delayed

**Revised Plan with Customer Revenue**:

| Month | Payroll | Ops | Revenue | Net Burn | Cash Balance |
|-------|---------|-----|---------|----------|--------------|
| M1-M5 | $1.7M | $0.5M | $0 | $(2.2M) | $2,000K → $(200K) |
| **Bridge needed: $200K** | | | | | |
| M6 | $470K | $20K | $8K | $(482K) | + $500K pre-seed → $18K |
| M7 | $520K | $25K | $15K | $(530K) | $18K - $530K = -$512K |

**Critical**: **First customer revenue must close by M5, not M6**.

---

### Year 1 Revised Timeline (With Revenue)

**Assume**: First customer contract signed Month 4, revenue starts Month 5

| Month | Payroll | Ops | Revenue | Net Burn | Runway |
|-------|---------|-----|---------|----------|--------|
| M1-M3 | - | - | - | $(1.3M) | $2,000K → $700K |
| M4 | $352K | $15K | $(0) | $(367K) | $700K → $333K |
| M5 | $352K | $15K | $8K | $(359K) | $333K → $(26K) |
| **Pre-seed close** | - | - | - | - | $(26K) + $500K = $474K |
| M6 | $470K | $20K | $20K | $(470K) | $474K → $4K |
| M7 | $520K | $25K | $30K | $(515K) | **RUNWAY CRITICAL** |

**Solution**: **Series A conversation starts Month 8-9, not Month 18**

With conservative timing:
- M1-M5: Build product, get first customer
- M6-M8: Prove model (3-5 customers, $30-50K MRR)
- M9-M12: Raise Series A (take 3 months)
- M12-M18: Use Series A to scale

---

### Year 2 Burn Projection (With Series A Close M18)

**Assumption**: Series A of $12M closes Month 18

| Period | Monthly Burn | Runway (on $12M) |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| M13-M17 (pre-Series A) | $1.6M | 7.5 months (on $2M remaining from pre-seed + customer revenue) |
| **Series A close M18** | - | +$12M injected |
| M18-M24 (post-Series A) | $2.0-3.4M | 3.5-6 months (depending on revenue ramp) |

**Year 2 cash waterfall**:

```
Starting cash (M18): $2M pre-seed remaining - $7.2M Y1 cumulative burn + $0.8M Y1 revenue = ~$0
Series A close: +$12M
Cash after Series A: $12M

M18-M24 burn:
- M18: $(1.9M)  → $12M → $10.1M
- M19: $(2.15M) → $10.1M → $7.95M
- M20: $(2.4M)  → $7.95M → $5.55M
- M21: $(2.65M) → $5.55M → $2.9M
- M22: $(2.9M)  → $2.9M → $0M (CRITICAL)
- M23-M24: Must have positive cash flow (revenue >burn)
```

**Key insight**: Series A must close by **Month 18 latest, Month 16 ideal** to ensure sufficient runway.

---

## Part 3: Revenue vs Burn Crossover (Profitability Timeline)

### Conservative Projections

**Year 1 Revenue Assumptions**:
- M1-M4: $0 (pre-revenue, POC stage)
- M5: $8K MRR ($10K customer, prorated)
- M6: $20K MRR (2 customers)
- M7: $30K MRR (3 customers)
- M8-M12: $40K MRR (4-5 customers ramp, slight churn)

**Year 1 Revenue Total**: ~$200K

**Year 1 Burn Total**: ~$12.5M (cumulative)

**Gap**: $(12.3M) → Requires $12.5M capital (pre-seed $0.5M + Series A $12M)

---

### Year 2 Revenue Ramp (Post-Series A)

**Assumption**: Series A hiring accelerates sales + product development

| Month | New Customers | MRR | ARR | Burn | Margin |
|-------|---------------|-----|-----|------|--------|
| M13 | 0 | $40K | $480K | $(1.6M) | negative |
| M14 | 1 | $50K | $600K | $(1.6M) | negative |
| M15 | 1 | $60K | $720K | $(1.6M) | negative |
| M16 | 1 | $70K | $840K | $(1.7M) | negative |
| M17 | 2 | $85K | $1.0M | $(1.7M) | negative |
| **M18** | **2** | **$100K** | **$1.2M** | **$(1.9M)** | **negative** |
| M19 | 2 | $125K | $1.5M | $(2.15M) | negative |
| M20 | 2 | $150K | $1.8M | $(2.4M) | negative |
| M21 | 3 | $180K | $2.16M | $(2.65M) | negative |
| M22 | 3 | $225K | $2.7M | $(2.9M) | **negative** |
| M23 | 3 | $290K | $3.48M | $(3.15M) | negative |
| M24 | 3 | $360K | $4.32M | $(3.4M) | negative |

**Profitability Timeline**:
- Year 2 still negative (burning $2-3M/month, revenue only $360K/month)
- **Breakeven projected: Q2 2027 (Month 20-21)**
- At Month 21: $180K MRR (~$2.16M ARR) vs $2.65M burn = still negative
- **True profitability**: Q4 2027 (Month 28-30), when MRR hits $250K+

---

## Part 4: Cash Flow Planning & Contingencies

### Runway Scenarios

**Base Case** (on plan):
- Pre-seed: $500K (12 months)
- Series A: $12M (18 months, close Month 18)
- Total runway: 30 months (to breakeven Month 28-30)

**Risk Case** (slower sales, Series A delayed):
- Pre-seed: $500K (12 months)
- Customer revenue: $200K (provides 2-3 month buffer)
- Series A: $12M (close Month 22-24, delayed 4-6 months)
- Total runway: 24 months (tighter)

**Mitigation**:
- Fundraise aggressively Month 12-16 (not Month 18)
- Build forward pipeline (6 months of committed revenue)
- Demonstrate strong unit economics ($3K CAC, $1M LTV)

---

### Spending Controls

**Pre-Series A Spending Caps**:

| Category | Monthly Cap | Gating Decision |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Payroll** | $1.5M | CEO approval + finance check |
| **Contractor burn** | $50K | Finance review |
| **Marketing** | $5K | CEO approval |
| **Travel** | $3K | VP-level approval |
| **Infrastructure** | $5K | CTO approval |
| **Unplanned spending** | $1K max | No approval needed |

**Post-Series A Spending Caps**:

| Category | Monthly Cap | Gating Decision |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Payroll** | $3.5M | Board approval if >10% variance |
| **Contractor burn** | $100K | CFO review |
| **Marketing** | $30K | VP Product approval |
| **Travel** | $10K | VP-level approval |
| **Infrastructure** | $10K | CTO approval |
| **Unplanned spending** | $5K max | Finance review |

---

### Cash Preservation Levers (If Needed)

If cash runway shortens unexpectedly:

1. **Hiring pause** (30-day reduction in burn)
   - Only backfills critical roles
   - Contractors paused (save $50K/month)
   - Impact: 3-month runway extension

2. **Salary reduction** (20% company-wide, temp)
   - CEO leads with 25% cut
   - All team 20% (temporary, revert with profitability or Series A)
   - Impact: 2-month runway extension
   - Legal: Document temporary reduction + make-good commitment

3. **Marketing/Travel freeze** (save $8K/month)
   - No conferences/events (pause $5K/month)
   - No business travel except customer-critical (save $3K/month)
   - Impact: 1-month runway extension

4. **Infrastructure optimization** (save $3-5K/month)
   - Migrate from paid to open-source tools
   - Consolidate cloud services
   - Impact: 1-month runway extension

**Combined levers if needed**:
- Hiring pause + salary reduction + marketing freeze = 6-month runway extension
- Only triggered if Series A delayed >2 months past target

## Appendix: Burn Calculation Methodology

**Total Monthly Burn Formula**:

```
Burn = Payroll + Benefits + Infrastructure + Sales/Marketing + Legal/Compliance + G&A - Revenue

Payroll: All employee salaries (prorated if mid-month hire)
Benefits: 15-18% of payroll (health, 401k, taxes, workers comp)
Infrastructure: GCP, Pub/Sub, monitoring ($5K base + 20% for growth)
Sales/Marketing: $2-5K pre-Series A, $30K+ post-Series A
Legal/Compliance: $2K/month base + $5-15K for milestones (409A, SOC2 init)
G&A: $2-5K for office, tools, misc
Revenue: MRR × 12 (annualized for monthly view)
```

**Example (Month 7)**:
```
Payroll: $1.312M
Benefits (17%): $223K
Infrastructure: $8K
Sales/Marketing: $8K
Legal/Compliance: $5K
G&A: $5K
Revenue: -$30K (MRR of $30K annualized)

Total Burn = $1.312M + $223K + $8K + $8K + $5K + $5K - $30K = $1.531M
```
