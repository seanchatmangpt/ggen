## 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR OUTCOME-BASED CONTRACTS

### 11.1 Outcome Achievement Not Guarantee of Future Performance

Client acknowledges that Outcome achievement in one period does not guarantee achievement in future periods.

Markets, operations, and external factors change. Provider's obligation is to perform Services per SOW; Outcome achievement depends partly on Client's operations and market conditions beyond Provider's control.

### 11.2 No Implied Warranty of Business Results

Client shall NOT interpret outcome-based pricing as "guarantee of business results."

Example: If Provider achieves 98% uptime (exceeding 95% target) but Client's revenue still declines, Client has no claim for lost revenue against Provider.

Outcome metrics measure Service performance, NOT Client's business outcome.

### 11.3 Material Changes to Client Operations

If Client materially changes operations, systems, or processes affecting Outcome achievement:
- Client must notify Provider in writing within 10 days
- Parties will adjust baseline and targets if material impact proven
- Variable compensation recalculated based on adjusted baseline
- Provider not liable for unachieved outcomes due to Client-caused changes

### 11.4 Annual True-Up

At end of each contract year, parties shall:
- Review actual Outcome performance
- Reconcile variable compensation paid vs. actual achievement
- Make adjustment (refund or additional payment) within 30 days
