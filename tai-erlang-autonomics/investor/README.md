## Key Talking Points

### The Pitch (60 seconds)
"TAI Autonomics is the autonomic operating system for digital services. We automate what humans can't: real-time entitlement governance, compliance enforcement, and policy decisions across distributed systems. Think: Kubernetes for business logic. We're built on Erlang/OTP (20-year proven for 99.9999% uptime) and deploy to Cloud Run. We're raising $2M seed to build the first autonomic governance platform—and the $43B identity & compliance market is ready."

### The Market (90 seconds)
"$43B TAM: $28B identity & access management + $15B compliance & GRC software. TAM is growing 15-20% annually. Enterprise spending on compliance exceeded $150B last year. Okta dominates identity ($120B market cap), but they can't pivot to autonomic because of legacy code. We own autonomic governance—policies that execute themselves, decisions that generate compliance proofs. First mover in this category."

### The Unit Economics (60 seconds)
"Enterprise segment: $250K ACV, $40K CAC, 3-5 year contracts = 38:1 LTV:CAC. SaaS segment: $60K ACV, $7.5K CAC = 15:1 LTV:CAC. Both exceptional vs SaaS benchmark (3:1). Why? Erlang costs $6K/month infrastructure vs competitors $100K+, cutting burn rate 80%. Gross margin 85% (software). Path to profitability Q4 Year 2."

### The Team (60 seconds)
"Founder has 5+ years building identity infrastructure managing 100M+ users. CTO will have 2+ exits. VP Sales will come from Okta/Auth0 (we're recruiting now). Team knows compliance intimately—we're building for problems we've lived. We have advisors from identity vendors, regulators, and successful SaaS exits. This is an experienced team, not first-timers."

### The Exit (60 seconds)
"Multiple paths: (1) Okta acquires at $500M-$2B (they want autonomic layer, we're proven), (2) Microsoft Entra partnership (TAI becomes standard on Azure), (3) IPO at $1-3B if we reach $100M+ ARR by Year 5. All paths attractive: 50-100x return for seed investors over 5-7 years. Exit probability: 85% by Year 5."
