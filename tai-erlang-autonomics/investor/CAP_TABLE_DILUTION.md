|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Pre-Seed** | 10,000,000 | 100% | Starting point |
| **Post-Seed** | 10,000,000 | 79.37% | $2M raised, 16.67% to investors |

- Post-Series A: $33M (66.67% × $50M)
- Post-Series B: $90M (45% × $200M)
- At IPO: $300-500M (30-35% × $1B+ valuation)

## Dilution Schedule (Realistic Path)

### Conservative Scenario (Slower Growth)

| Stage | Investment | Pre-Money | Post-Money | Founder % | New Investors % |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | - | - | $10M | 100% | - |
| **Seed (Y1)** | $2M | $10M | $12M | 83.33% | 16.67% |
| **Series A (M24)** | $10M | $40M | $50M | 66.67% | 16.67% |
| **Series B (Y4)** | $30M | $150M | $180M | 50% | 25% |
| **IPO (Y7)** | $100M | $900M | $1B | 30% | 70% |

**Founder ownership decline**: 100% → 30% over 7 years (typical for well-managed startups)

### Aggressive Scenario (Faster Growth)

| Stage | Investment | Pre-Money | Post-Money | Founder % | New Investors % |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | - | - | $10M | 100% | - |
| **Seed (Y1)** | $2M | $10M | $12M | 83.33% | 16.67% |
| **Series A (M18)** | $15M | $50M | $65M | 62.75% | 23.08% |
| **Series B (Y2.5)** | $50M | $250M | $300M | 42% | 20% |
| **IPO (Y4-5)** | $150M | $1.5B | $1.65B | 25% | 75% |

**Benefits of faster growth**:
- Higher post-money valuations at each stage
- Fewer dilution points
- Founder retains more equity
- Shorter time to profitability

## Anti-Dilution & Rights

### Standard Terms for Seed Round

**Investor Rights**:
1. **Liquidation Preference**: 1x non-participating preferred (typical)
   - Investors get invested amount back before common shareholders in exit
   - Non-participating: if common share value > preference, take common route

2. **Anti-Dilution**: Broad-based weighted average
   - Protects against down rounds
   - Fair to founders (less punitive than narrow-based)

3. **Pro-Rata Rights**: Right to participate in future rounds
   - Investors can maintain ownership %

4. **Board Observation**: Right to attend board meetings
   - Information rights
   - Early warning of company changes

### Valuation Milestones (Anti-Dilution Triggers)

**Scenario**: What if Series A valuation is lower?

| Scenario | Pre-A Valuation | Impact | Anti-Dilution |
|----------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| **Base Case** | $40-50M | 4-5x seed | None triggered |
| **Down Round** | $20M | 2x seed | Weighted average kicks in |
| **Significant Down** | $10M | 1x seed | Protects investors |

**Impact on founder dilution** (if $20M Series A instead of $50M):
- Without anti-dilution: Founder keeps 66.67%
- With anti-dilution: Founder 50-55% (depending on formula)
- Difference: 10-15% of company

**Recommendation**: Negotiate founder-friendly anti-dilution at seed round

---

## Employee Ownership & Incentives

### Equity Grants by Role (Year 1-2 Hiring)

| Role | Level | Option Grant | Annual Refresh | 4-Yr Vesting Value |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Chief Technology Officer** | C-level | 100,000 | $50K worth | $200-400K over 4 yrs |
| **VP Sales** | Director | 50,000 | $25K worth | $100-200K over 4 yrs |
| **Senior Engineer** | Senior | 30,000-40,000 | $15-20K worth | $60-160K over 4 yrs |
| **Engineer** | Mid | 15,000-20,000 | $7-10K worth | $30-80K over 4 yrs |
| **Product Manager** | Senior | 25,000 | $12.5K worth | $50-100K over 4 yrs |

**Equity value appreciation path**:
- Seed round: $1.00/share (option strike)
- Series A: $4-5/share
- Series B: $10-15/share
- IPO: $100-500/share (depending on pricing)

**Example: Senior engineer at Seed + 20,000 options**
- 4-year value at Series A: 20,000 × $4.50 = $90K
- 4-year value at Series B: 20,000 × $12 = $240K
- 4-year value at IPO: 20,000 × $150 = $3M

### Equity Compensation Strategy

1. **Competitive with market**
   - Seed-stage company needs equity to be competitive on cash
   - Typical: $120-150K cash + $25-50K annual equity value

2. **Aligned incentives**
   - Options vest over 4 years to align long-term interests
   - 1-year cliff prevents short-term employees from vesting immediately

3. **Cash efficiency**
   - At seed round, equity is ~2:1 vs cash cost
   - Using $2M to fund 6-person team more efficiently

4. **Employee retention**
   - Vesting creates golden handcuffs
   - Each vesting milestone creates retention event
   - Annual refresh equity keeps retention fresh

## Acquisition/Exit Scenarios & Payouts

### Acquisition at Year 3 ($100M Enterprise Value)

**Assumptions**:
- Acquire at $100M valuation (5-10x revenue multiple)
- Paid in cash + stock earn-out
- 2-year earn-out period (50% at close, 50% at Year 2)

**Payout Breakdown**:

| Stakeholder | Ownership | Payout (50% at close) | Earn-Out (50% in Year 2) | Total |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Founder** | 66.67% | $33.3M | $16.67M | **$50M** |
| **Seed Investors** | 13.33% | $6.67M | $3.33M | **$10M** |

| **Employees (vested)** | 3.33% | $1.67M | $0.83M | **$2.5M** |
| **Total** | 100% | $50M | $25M | **$75M** |

**Tax implications** (example, not advice):
- Founder: Long-term capital gains on $50M (~20% federal = $10M tax)
- Net to founder: ~$40M

### IPO at Year 7 ($1B Valuation)

**Assumptions**:
- IPO at $1B valuation (10x revenue multiple for $100M ARR)
- Lock-up period: 180 days post-IPO
- Founder retains 30% ownership

**Payout at IPO**:

| Shareholder | Ownership | Value at IPO | Notes |

| **Early investors** | 15% | $150M | Significant returns |
| **Series A/B** | 35% | $350M | Institutional holders |
| **Employees/Options** | 20% | $200M | Critical for retention |

**Return multiples**:
- Seed investors (2M at $2M): 50x return at IPO
- Series A investors (10M at $10M): 10x return at IPO
- Founder (starting 100%): 30x net worth increase

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Cap Table Health Indicators

| Metric | Seed Target | Series A Target | Series B Target |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Founder Ownership** | 80-85% | 60-70% | 45-55% |
| **Employee Pool** | 3-5% | 10-15% | 15-20% |
| **Investor Ownership** | 15-20% | 20-30% | 20-30% |
| **Fully Diluted Shares** | 12-13M | 15-20M | 20-30M |

### Dilution Impact on Decision-Making

**Each future round will dilute founding team**:
- Series A: ~16% dilution from seed levels
- Series B: ~20% dilution from Series A levels
- Pre-IPO: ~15-20% final dilution

**Best practice**: Minimize dilution by:
1. Growing revenue faster (higher valuation)
2. Achieving profitability (less capital needed)
3. Negotiating lower ownership targets with VCs
4. Retaining key talent (avoid option refresh bloat)
