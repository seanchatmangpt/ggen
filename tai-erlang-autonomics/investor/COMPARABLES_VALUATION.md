## Valuation by Stage: Industry Benchmarks

### Seed Round Valuation Benchmarks

**For $2M seed investment**:

| Category | Typical Valuation | Ownership for $2M | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Very Early** | $4-8M | 20-50% | Pre-product or MVP |
| **Early Traction** | $8-15M | 13-25% | TAI's position |
| **Strong Growth** | $15-30M | 7-13% | >$100K MRR |
| **Hypergrowth** | $30-50M+ | <7% | $1M+ MRR |

**TAI's seed round**:
- Pre-money: $8-10M
- Investment: $2M
- Post-money: $10-12M
- Investor ownership: 16.67-20%

**This is appropriate because**:
✓ MVP complete (69 Erlang modules, production-ready)
✓ Technology validated (Erlang/OTP proven)
✓ Team experienced (identity experts)
✓ Market validated (TAM confirmed)

### Series A Valuation Benchmarks (12-18 months post-seed)

**Based on ARR achievement**:

| ARR | Valuation Range | Multiple | Typical Companies |
|-----|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **<$500K** | $5-15M | 10-30x | Very early SaaS |
| **$500K-$1M** | $15-30M | 15-30x | Growing SaaS |
| **$1M-$2M** | $30-75M | 15-37.5x | Hypergrowth SaaS |
| **$2M-$5M** | $75-150M | 15-30x | Strong SaaS |
| **$5M+** | $150M+ | 15-30x | Enterprise SaaS |

**TAI's projected Series A** (Month 18-24):
- Expected ARR: $2M
- Valuation range: $50-75M
- Multiple: 25-37.5x
- This is at upper end due to growth rate

### Series B Valuation Benchmarks (18-24 months post-Series A)

**For strong SaaS**:

| ARR | Valuation Range | Multiple | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **$10M** | $150-300M | 15-30x | Strong growth |
| **$15M** | $300-450M | 20-30x | TAI's projection |
| **$25M** | $500M-1B | 20-40x | Hypergrowth |
| **$50M+** | $1B+ | 20-50x | Exceptional |

**TAI's projected Series B** (Year 3-4):
- Expected ARR: $15M
- Valuation range: $300-450M
- Multiple: 20-30x
- Reflects maturation but continued growth

### IPO Valuation Benchmarks

**Current SaaS multiples at IPO** (2023-2025):

| Category | Typical Multiple | Recent Examples |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **High growth (>30% YoY)** | 20-50x | Datadog, Snyk, Figma |
| **Growth (15-30% YoY)** | 10-20x | Cloudflare, Twilio |
| **Moderate (5-15% YoY)** | 5-10x | Zoom, CrowdStrike |
| **Mature (<5% YoY)** | 2-5x | Legacy software |

**TAI's IPO potential**:
- Expected ARR at IPO: $100M+
- Expected growth rate: 20%+ (modest slowing from seed)
- Valuation multiple: 10-30x (depending on growth)
- IPO valuation: $1-3B (conservative)

## Valuation Bridge: Seed to Series A

### Method 1: Revenue Multiple Approach

**Starting point**: $8-10M seed round valuation

**Growth multiplier**:
- Seed stage to Series A: Expect 5-10x revenue growth
- If $2M Series A ARR on 25x multiple = $50M valuation
- Growth multiple: 5x ($10M → $50M)

**Formula**:
```
Series A Valuation = Seed Valuation × Growth Multiplier
$50M = $10M × 5x
```

### Method 2: Comparable Company Approach

**Compare to Auth0**:
- Auth0 at Series D: $20M ARR, $1B valuation (50x)
- Back-calculate Auth0 at Series A: ~$500K ARR, ~$25M valuation (50x)
- TAI at Series A: $2M ARR, $50-75M valuation (25-37.5x multiple)
- TAI premium: Higher growth rate (25x vs 50x multiple shows conservative positioning)

### Method 3: Venture Capital Method (Reverse)

**Target exit valuation**: $1B+ (conservative)
**Required IRR**: 25-35% (VC standard)
**Time to exit**: 5-7 years

**Calculation**:
```
Series A Valuation = Exit Valuation / (1 + IRR)^Years
Series A Valuation = $1B / (1.35)^5
Series A Valuation = $1B / 5.5
Series A Valuation = ~$180M
```

**This suggests Series A could be $50-180M range**
- Lower bound ($50M): Assumes 30% IRR, 5-year horizon, $1B exit
- Upper bound ($180M): Assumes 25% IRR, 7-year horizon, $1B exit
- TAI's $50-75M is at lower-middle range (conservative)

| **Team Size** | 2-3 | 10+ | 5-10 | 5-10 |
| **VC Backing** | First-time | Y Combinator | Y Combinator | Y Combinator |

- ✓ Multiple GTM paths (enterprise + SaaS + embedded)
- ✗ Smaller team at seed (offset by senior experience)
- ✗ New category (autonomic governance)
