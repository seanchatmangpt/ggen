WHAT THESE DOCUMENTS SOLVE
================================================================================

PROBLEM 1: No visibility into product quality during 13-week sprint
SOLUTION: PRODUCT_EXECUTION_LOG.md tracks uptime, bugs, performance weekly

PROBLEM 2: Customer feedback scattered across emails/calls

PROBLEM 3: Don't know when technical debt needs fixing
SOLUTION: PRODUCT_EXECUTION_LOG.md Section 9 tracks + schedules debt fixes

PROBLEM 4: No clear process for handling critical bugs or incidents
SOLUTION: PRODUCT_EXECUTION_LOG.md Section 10 includes incident playbook

PROBLEM 5: Missing framework for v1.1 roadmap planning
SOLUTION: V1.1_ROADMAP.md Sections 1-3 provide decision criteria + anticipated requests

PROBLEM 6: Don't know how to communicate product status weekly
SOLUTION: PRODUCT_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md Section on standup talking points

PROBLEM 7: Team doesn't know which document to reference
