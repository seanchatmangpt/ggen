# V1.1 ROADMAP: TAI Erlang Autonomics

**Planning Period:** Weeks 10-13 (Month 4 starts execution)
**Target Release:** Month 4 (April 26 - May 31, 2026)
**Status:** PLANNING TEMPLATE (awaiting customer feedback)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

V1.1 roadmap will be defined during Weeks 10-13 based on:

1. **Customer #1 Feedback** (3 months of usage by Week 13)
2. **Customers #2 & #3 Feedback** (1-2 months of usage by Week 13)
3. **Performance Data** (real usage patterns + bottlenecks)
4. **Technical Debt Accumulation** (shortcuts from V1.0 MVP)
5. **Sales Pipeline Themes** (what prospects ask for)

**Philosophy:** Fix the 80/20 - highest-impact items that 3 customers need.

---

## SECTION 1: V1.1 PLANNING FRAMEWORK

### Decision Criteria (In Priority Order)

1. **Customer Blocking Issues** - Prevents customer value
   - Example: "Pricing rules don't support our use case"
   - Fix priority: 1-2 weeks (ship before churn risk)

2. **Performance Constraints** - Limit growth
   - Example: "Reports take 30 seconds for 1M transactions"
   - Fix priority: 2-3 weeks (needed for next customer cohort)

3. **Integration Gaps** - Required for adoption
   - Example: "Need Salesforce sync for sales team"
   - Fix priority: 2-4 weeks (common in sales pipeline)

4. **Scaling Requirements** - Infrastructure near limits
   - Example: "Need database sharding for 10-customer scale"
   - Fix priority: 3-4 weeks (pre-emptive for Series A growth)

5. **Technical Debt** - Maintenance burden
   - Example: "Pricing calculation code has 5 copies (DRY violation)"
   - Fix priority: 1-2 weeks (prevents bugs + speeds future development)

6. **UX Improvements** - Friction in adoption
   - Example: "Onboarding takes 2 hours, should be 20 min"
   - Fix priority: 2-3 weeks (nice-to-have, not blocking)

---

## SECTION 8: DECISION POINTS & GATES

### Gate 1: Customer Feedback Collection (End of Week 11)

**Owner:** VP Product
**Input:** Customer interviews + usage data + support ticket analysis
**Output:** Prioritized feature list (top 20 requests ranked)
**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All 3 customers interviewed
- [ ] Top 5 feature requests identified with frequency data
- [ ] Effort estimates obtained from engineering
- [ ] Sales themes aligned with engineering feedback

**If Fails:** Extend by 1 week, escalate to board meeting

---

### Gate 2: Roadmap Approval (End of Week 11)

**Owner:** Board + Founder/CEO
**Input:** Prioritized feature list + effort estimates + resource plan
**Output:** Approved v1.1 roadmap + committed sprints
**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] 5 epics defined with clear success criteria
- [ ] Resource plan aligned with hiring timeline
- [ ] Engineering estimates <2 weeks variance
- [ ] Board unanimous approval

**If Fails:** Iterate on resource plan or scope, re-vote

---

### Gate 3: Month 4 Sprint Planning (Week 13)

**Owner:** VP Engineering
**Input:** Approved epics + user stories
**Output:** Sprint-by-sprint delivery plan + team assignments
**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All stories estimated in story points
- [ ] Team velocity confirmed (based on Month 3)
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] 0% risk of schedule slip

**If Fails:** Reduce scope or extend timeline to Month 5

---

## SECTION 9: COMMUNICATION PLAN

### Customer Communication

**Week 11:** Announce "v1.1 roadmap being finalized based on your feedback"

**Week 13:** Share roadmap preview with all 3 customers
- Include: Top 5 features they requested + estimated delivery
- Exclude: Lower-priority items (avoid expectation setting)

**Monthly:** Publish roadmap updates in customer newsletter
- Format: "In Month 4, we shipped X + Y. Next month focusing on Z."

### Sales Communication

**Week 11:** Brief sales team on top 3 roadmap items
- Talking points: "For prospects asking for X feature, here's our timeline"

**Weekly:** Sales standup includes "Roadmap messaging of the week"
- Help sales address prospect objections with feature timeline

### Investor Communication

**Week 13:** Include roadmap in Series A materials
- Narrative: "First 90 days validated problem. Month 4 scaling features."

---

## SECTION 10: RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Roadmap Too Ambitious

**Probability:** 30% (common in startups)

**Mitigation:**
- Forecast velocity conservatively (e.g., 25 SP vs. planned 30 SP)
- Target 2-3 shipped epics per month (not 5)
- Prioritize: Customer blocking >> Sales blocking >> Nice-to-have
- Buffer: 1 week for unforeseen issues

**Escalation:** If Sprint 1 velocity <20 SP, reduce Month 4 scope

---

### Risk 2: Hiring Not Complete by Week 10

**Probability:** 25% (common hiring challenge)

**Mitigation:**
- Plan with current team size (5.5 FTE) + 1099 contractors
- Defer lower-priority epics (e.g., Epic 4 security moved to Month 5)
- Focus on 2-3 high-impact epics first
- Hire aggressively in Month 4

**Escalation:** If 2+ roles unfilled by Apr 1, reduce roadmap by 30%

---

### Risk 3: Customer Requests Diverge

**Probability:** 40% (very common)

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize by "number of customers asking" (voting mechanism)
- If 3 customers want different things, 2-out-of-3 wins
- For 1-customer-only requests, offer via integration or custom build (not core)

**Escalation:** Conflict resolution via weekly product review

---

### Risk 4: Performance Issues Block Features

**Probability:** 20% (dependent on v1.0 architecture)

**Mitigation:**
- Run load test in Week 10 with 2x customer data
- Identify bottlenecks early
- Start Epic 5 (performance) in Week 1 Month 4 (before scale issues)

**Escalation:** If load test fails, pause other epics and focus on performance

---

## SECTION 11: SUCCESS NARRATIVE (FOR INVESTORS)

**For Series A Pitch (Month 5-6):**

```
TAI V1.1 Roadmap:
Validated $125K ARR baseline with 3 customers (Month 1-3)
→ Month 4: Shipped 2-3 enterprise features
→ Customer adoption: NPS improved to 8.5, churn 0%
→ Sales impact: 2+ new customers cited roadmap features
→ Revenue impact: $180K ARR (44% growth Month 1→4)
→ Engineering: Reduced debt, velocity up 30%
→ Next: Series A-funded roadmap for Q2 (100+ seat enterprise targets)

Core Thesis:
"Market validated. Product-market fit proven.
Now scaling with customer-driven roadmap.
$125K → $500K ARR achievable in 12 months with 4-5 FTE engineering."
```
