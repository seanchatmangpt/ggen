### 1.3 LinkedIn Post Templates & Examples

**Template 1: Thought Leadership Thread (6-8 posts)**

```
POST 1:
"The biggest hidden cost in SaaS isn't engineering, sales, or support.

It's manual SKU management.

A thread on why infrastructure invisibility is bleeding your margins...
🧵"

Likes Goal: 20+
Comments Goal: 10+
Shares Goal: 5+

POST 2:
"At Company X, I watched one engineer spend 80% of their time on
entitlement provisioning. New tier launches took 2 weeks. Zero audit
trail for compliance.

This is not unique. Every SaaS company with 30+ SKUs faces this."

POST 3:
"The real cost:
• 1 FTE × $150K salary = $150K/year
• Engineering time for custom solutions (never works)
• Compliance violations ($50K-$500K each)
• Missed revenue from slow tier launches

Total hidden cost: $500K-$2M/year in most mid-market SaaS"

POST 4:
"Most companies try:
1. Database-based governance (slow, doesn't scale)
2. Custom engineering (expensive, 6-12 month build)
3. Third-party SaaS (lock-in, integration mess)

None of these solve the core problem: autonomic decision-making
at <50ms latency."

POST 5:
"What if your entitlements governed themselves?

That's the vision behind TAI. Declarative rules. Distributed enforcement.
Cryptographic audit trails. <50ms latency."

POST 6:
"We spent last 6 months building TAI on Erlang/OTP for fault tolerance
+ GCP Cloud Run for scale. 3 customers live. $125K ARR. Proof of concept
complete.

The future of infrastructure is autonomic."

POST 7:
"If you have 30+ SKUs and you're managing them manually, we should talk.

Drop a comment or DM me. I'm buying coffee for the next 10 founders
who are tired of SKU toil.

🚀"

ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:
- Respond to all comments within 2 hours
- Like + reply to every comment
- Retweet/share responses from other founders
- Goal: 50+ total engagement by end of week
```

**Template 2: Social Proof Post**

```
"Huge milestone: [Customer #1 Name] just hit 97% inventory accuracy
with TAI autonomic governance.

From managing entitlements manually to autonomous enforcement in 6 weeks.

Metrics:
• 60 hours/month saved ⏱️
• Zero compliance violations 📋
• 3x ROI in year one 📈

This is why we're building TAI 🚀

[Attachment: Case study PDF or carousel with metrics]"

Likes Goal: 30+
Comments Goal: 8+
Shares Goal: 5+
```

**Template 3: Behind-the-Scenes / Team Culture**

```
"Building infrastructure shouldn't be lonely.

Our team at TAI (5.5 FTE) just shipped autonomous SKU governance
to 3 production customers. Some reflections:

🔹 Hiring for values > hiring for experience
   (teach the tech, keep the culture)

🔹 Customer conversations > investor pitches
   (real problems beat deck perfection)

🔹 Erlang for fault tolerance > speed alone
   (we'll go fast AND reliable)

🔹 Shipping > perfecting
   (feedback loops are your best teacher)

We're hiring 2 backend engineers. Come build the invisible infrastructure
of the future with us.

Comments Goal: 5+
```

**Template 4: Industry Commentary**

```
"Hot take: The SaaS industry is paying $2B/year for a solved problem.

Every mid-market SaaS company with 30+ SKUs is managing entitlements
manually. That's:

📊 50,000+ companies × $500K/year = $25B total addressable market

The first platform to commoditize this will capture 10% of that TAM
= $2.5B opportunity.

We're going after it with TAI.

Who else sees this opportunity? 🧵👇"

## 2. TWITTER STRATEGY

### 2.1 Account Setup

```
Handle: @TAI_autonomics (or @AutonomicSKU)

Bio (160 characters):
"Autonomous SKU governance for SaaS infrastructure. <50ms latency.
Cryptographic audit trails. Building at @YCombinator"

Profile Image: TAI logo (same as website)
Cover Image: Architecture diagram (control + data plane)
Pinned Tweet: Link to website + "Welcome to TAI" statement
Website Link: tai-erlang.ai
Location: San Francisco, CA
```

### 2.2 Twitter Content Mix

**Content Distribution (12+ tweets per week):**
```
Technical Insights (40%):     5 tweets
Industry Commentary (30%):    3-4 tweets
Product Updates (20%):        2-3 tweets
Community Engagement (10%):   1-2 tweets
```

### 2.3 Twitter Post Examples

**Example 1: Technical Thread (8 tweets)**
```
Tweet 1:
"Building a <50ms entitlement check system for 10k concurrent users
is harder than it sounds.

A thread on the architectural decisions we made at @TAI_autonomics:

🧵"

Tweet 2:
"Problem: Database queries for entitlements = latency
Solution: In-memory governors + local caching
Result: p99 latency = 18ms (vs 200ms on DBs)

Why? Erlang processes are cheap. Concurrency is free."

Tweet 3:
"Second big decision: Cryptographic receipts for compliance

Every entitlement decision is cryptographically signed.
This means:
✓ Tamper-proof audit trail
✓ Real-time compliance verification
✓ No manual reconciliation"

Tweet 4:
"Third: Supervisor trees for fault tolerance

If a governor crashes, automatically restart it. If that fails, isolate
to a single tenant. If the whole system goes down, customers still
make decisions (cached rules).

Invisibility through resilience."

Tweet 5:
"Fourth: Hot reloading without dropping requests

Deploy new governance rules without disrupting customers. This is
huge for companies that move fast and need to experiment with pricing.

Most platforms require downtime. We don't."

Tweet 6:
"Fifth: Multi-tenant isolation at the core

Each tenant has its own governor processes. One tenant's CPU spike
doesn't affect another's latency. This is critical at scale."

Tweet 7:
"The result: We handle 10k+ concurrent governors at <50ms p99.

Benchmarks:
- Throughput: 50k req/sec
- Memory: 50MB per 1k governors
- Deployment: 30-second rolling updates
- Uptime: 99.99%"

Tweet 8:
"Want to build something similar? We're hiring 2 backend engineers.

DM me if you're interested in:
- Erlang/OTP
- Distributed systems
- Building infrastructure that scales

Let's go. 🚀"

Engagement Goal: 20+ likes, 5+ retweets, 10+ replies
```

**Example 2: Industry Commentary**

```
"The SKU management crisis is real. I just talked to 5 SaaS founders
last week, and 4 of them have 1+ FTE stuck in entitlement provisioning.

This is a $2B+ opportunity waiting to be solved.

@TAI_autonomics is going after it."

Engagement Goal: 15+ likes, 3+ retweets
```

**Example 3: Product Update**

```
"🎉 TAI v1.2 is live with hot-reload support

Deploy new tier rules without dropping requests.
This is huge for our customers who move fast.

📖 Download: [link to docs]
🚀 Try it: [link to free trial]"

Engagement Goal: 10+ likes, 2+ retweets
```

**Example 4: Engagement / Relationship Building**

```
"RT @thoughtleader: 'Erlang's supervisor trees are criminally underrated'

Absolutely. This is why we built @TAI_autonomics on Erlang/OTP.

Fault tolerance > raw performance for infrastructure.

What's your take?"

Engagement Goal: Show up in their mentions, build relationship
```

**Example 5: Behind-the-Scenes**

```
"6am deployment. 50ms latency. All 3 customers live.

Days like this remind me why we love building infrastructure.

Invisibility is the ultimate compliment. 🚀"

Engagement Goal: 12+ likes, authentic connection
```
