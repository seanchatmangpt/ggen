## FAQ: Common Questions

### Q: What if we miss the Week 10 Customer #2 closure?
**A:** Extend to Week 11 (1-week delay acceptable). Update forecast. Key is maintaining momentum. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

### Q: How do we handle Customer #1 while scaling?
**A:** CSM manages production support. CTO supports implementations. Week 10-11 is CSM-heavy. Week 12-13 is 50/50 (implementations + new POCs).

### Q: What if a customer goes into churn risk?
**A:** Escalate to CEO + CTO immediately. Increase check-in frequency. Review contract + success plan. Typical fix: more training + customization.

### Q: When do we start Series A conversations?
**A:** Start informal conversations Week 11-12 (once #2 signed). Formal fundraising Week 13+ (once all 3 live). Never fundraise during customer acquisition—focus on execution first.

### Q: What's our biggest risk?
**A:** Sales cycle extending past Week 10-11. Mitigation: Warm intros only, compressed POCs (7 days), pre-approved pricing band. Execution risk is low (proven with 3 customers already).

### Q: How do we use the case studies?
**A:** (1) Sales qualification (send relevant case study to warm leads), (2) Investor proof (show investor 3 customer stories), (3) Website (publish to establish credibility), (4) Training (show new sales reps success pattern).
