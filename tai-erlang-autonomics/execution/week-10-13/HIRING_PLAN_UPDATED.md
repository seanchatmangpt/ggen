## Executive Summary

As TAI Autonomics closes customers #2 and #3, team capacity becomes critical. Current team (5.5 FTE) can execute one customer onboarding at a time. Scaling to 3 simultaneous customers requires:

1. **CTO/VP Engineering** - Scale technical infrastructure, hire engineering team
2. **Sales Coordinator** - Handle scheduling, proposals, admin
3. **Customer Success Manager** - Own customer #2 and #3 implementations
4. **Backend Engineers (2)** - Contractor or FTE for integrations
5. **Operations/Finance (part-time)** - Billing, contracts, compliance

## Part 9: Contingency & Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: CTO Not Found in Timeframe (HIGH)

**Probability:** Medium (good talent is hard to find)
**Impact:** Engineering falls behind, customer integrations delayed

**Mitigation:**
1. Start recruiting Week 10 (not Week 11)
2. Consider interim solutions:
   - Fractional CTO ($5K-10K/month) while hiring full-time
   - Angel/advisor who owns engineering part-time
3. Extend offer range: $150K-250K (not just $150K-200K)
4. Equity: 0.75%-1.5% (top end) to attract strong candidates

**Fallback:** If CTO not hired by Week 13:
- Extend contractor engineering through Month 5
- Hire VP Sales to close customers
- CEO manages engineering (temporary, 3-month max)

### Risk 2: CSM or Sales Coordinator Not Hired (MEDIUM)

**Probability:** Low (less competitive roles)
**Impact:** Sales and customer success slow down

**Mitigation:**
1. CSM: Can be trained from scratch (less critical to have perfect fit)
2. Sales Coordinator: Definitely needed (takes load off VP Sales)
3. If delayed: Hire Sales Coordinator first (higher ROI on CEO time)

**Fallback:** If CSM not hired by Week 12:
- VP Sales manages customer #2 + #3 onboarding (temporary)
- Hire contract CSM at $5K/month

### Risk 3: Contractor Engineers Don't Work Out (MEDIUM)

**Probability:** Low (proper vetting should catch this)
**Impact:** Customer integrations delayed, technical debt

**Mitigation:**
1. Vet heavily: GitHub history, references, live code challenge
2. 1-week trial period (let them code in real environment)
3. Weekly check-ins (CTO) to catch issues early
4. Clear deliverables (integration specs, code quality standards)

**Fallback:** If contractor underperforming by Week 3:
- Replace contractor (1-week notice)
- Hire new contractor (overlapping 1-2 weeks)
- Hire second FTE engineer earlier (Month 5→Month 4)

### Risk 4: Offer Negotiation Falls Through (MEDIUM)

**Probability:** Low (startup equity usually attractive)
**Impact:** Time lost, recruitment restart, hiring delays

**Mitigation:**
1. Set target salary bands (don't go above/below)
2. Get investor buy-in on offers before extending
3. Have backup candidates ready
4. Clear communication: This is our best offer

**Fallback:** If offer falls through:
- Move to next candidate (should have 2-3 in final round)
- Extend to next tier (lower equity for lower salary tolerance)
