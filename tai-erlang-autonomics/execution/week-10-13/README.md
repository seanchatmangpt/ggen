- VP Sales: "Customer #3 call today - they're excited. Sent proposal. Discovery calls with 2 new prospects. Pipeline now $350K."
- CSM: "Customer #1 pilot warehouse hitting 97% accuracy. Customer #2 onboarding scheduled. Team bandwidth good."

### Every Friday (4pm Weekly Review - 30 min)
**Review:**

## 📞 Support & Questions

### Question: "What if we miss the Week 10 closure deadline?"
**Answer:** Still viable. Extend to Week 11 (1-week delay acceptable). Update forecast. Key is maintaining execution rigor and customer momentum.

### Question: "How do we handle Customer #1 while scaling?"
**Answer:** CSM manages production, CTO supports go-live. Week 10-11 is CSM-heavy (onboarding). Week 12-13 is 50/50 (go-live support + new POCs).

### Question: "What if a customer goes into churn risk?"
**Answer:** Escalate to CEO + CTO. Increase check-in frequency. Review contract + success plan. Typical fix: more training + customization.

### Question: "Series A conversation - when to start?"
**Answer:** Start informal conversations Week 11-12 (once #2 signed). Formal fundraising Week 13+ (once all 3 live). Never fundraise during customer acquisition.
