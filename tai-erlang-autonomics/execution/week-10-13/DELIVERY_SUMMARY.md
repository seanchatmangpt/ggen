### Why Investors Will Back TAI

## 🔍 What Success Looks Like (Vision)

### End of Week 13
You're standing in front of investors saying:

> "We've built a platform that solves a $50B problem. Three customers have signed up and are live in production. We're generating $125K in annualized revenue. Our unit economics are exceptional—$5K CAC, $150K+ LTV, 41-day payback. We have a repeatable go-to-market engine that closes customers in 21 days. Our customers are seeing real value: $700K+ in annual savings on average, 97% accuracy, and they love us (8.5 NPS). We've got a $450K+ qualified pipeline of new customers ready to close. This is proof that the market wants what we're building. With this Series A, we'll expand our sales team and achieve $1M+ ARR within 12 months."

**That's the power of this execution package.**
