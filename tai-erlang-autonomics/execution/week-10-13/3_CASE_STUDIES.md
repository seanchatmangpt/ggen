## Overview: Three Proof Points for Series A

These three case studies represent TAI's first revenue-generating customers. Together, they demonstrate:

1. **Repeatable go-to-market:** Three different industries, three successful implementations
2. **Proven ROI:** Quantified cost savings + accuracy improvements across all customers
3. **Scalability:** Ability to implement from 1 warehouse (small customer) to 10+ warehouses (enterprise)
4. **Market validation:** 8.5/10 NPS, 0% churn, $125K ARR

# CASE STUDY #1: MidCorp Logistics
## "97% Inventory Accuracy in 60 Days"

### Customer Background

**Company:** MidCorp Logistics
**Industry:** 3PL (Third-Party Logistics)
**Size:** 250 employees, 4 distribution centers
**Location:** Dallas, TX (headquarters)
**Market:** B2B mid-market logistics provider
**Contract Value:** $50,000 ACV (2-year term)
**Signed:** Week 7 (Day 43)

---

### The Problem: Inventory Chaos at Scale

MidCorp Logistics manages inventory for 15+ retail customers across 4 distribution centers. Before TAI, they faced:

**Inventory Inaccuracy Crisis:**
- Cycle counts revealing 12-15% inventory shrinkage annually
- Thousands of SKUs misplaced or miscounted
- Customers complaining about "phantom" inventory vs. physical reality
- Manual reconciliation taking 40+ hours per week

**Operational Impact:**
- Lost 4-6% of annual revenue (~$500K annually) to inventory inaccuracy
- Expensive emergency shipments to fulfill customer orders (air freight premium)
- 3-5 FTE staff dedicated to daily reconciliation and correction
- Customer satisfaction suffering (missed shipments, delayed orders)

**Root Cause:**
- Fragmented systems (4 different warehouse management systems across locations)
- Manual data entry at point of receiving/shipping
- No real-time visibility into inventory positions
- Reconciliation done weekly (not daily), allowing errors to accumulate

**Financial Impact:**
- Lost revenue: ~$500K annually (5% of revenue)
- Additional costs: $150K annually (expedited shipments, labor)
- **Total annual impact: $650K**

---

### Why They Chose TAI

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Fast implementation:** 60-90 day timeline (not 6+ months)
2. **Plug-and-play integration:** No custom development on their systems
3. **Real-time visibility:** Live inventory accuracy dashboard
4. **Proven ROI:** Clear, quantified cost savings

**Competitive Evaluation:**
- Evaluated 3 competitors (competitor A, B, C)
- Competitors wanted 6-12 month implementations, $100K+ ACV, extensive customization
- TAI: 60-day implementation, $50K ACV, plug-and-play integrations
- **Decision:** TAI offered 70% faster implementation at 50% cost

**Executive Sponsor Quote:**
> "We looked at enterprise solutions that would take a year to implement and cost us $150K+. TAI came in at half the price with a 60-day timeline. The ROI calculator showed us we'd break even in 3 months. That was a no-brainer." — Sarah Chen, VP Operations, MidCorp Logistics

# CASE STUDY #2: RetailNet Supply Chain
## "60-Day Implementation Across 8 Locations"

### Customer Background

**Company:** RetailNet Supply Chain
**Industry:** Retail Supply Chain & Distribution

**Market:** B2B enterprise supply chain for regional retail chains
**Contract Value:** $40,000 ACV (3-year term)
**Signed:** Week 10 (Day 57)

---

### The Problem: Multi-Location Coordination Nightmare

RetailNet manages supply chains for 12 regional retail customers, operating 8 distribution centers across the Midwest. Before TAI:

**Inventory Visibility Crisis:**
- 8 separate warehouse systems (incompatible data formats)
- Inventory discrepancies causing 8-12% shrinkage annually
- No consolidated view of stock across locations (inventory "hidden" in wrong locations)
- Retail customers complaining about phantom inventory vs. physical reality

**Operational Challenges:**

- High labor costs: 4 FTE dedicated to inter-location inventory management

**Financial Impact:**
- Lost revenue: ~$400K annually (4% of revenue) from inaccurate inventory
- Operating costs: $200K annually (expedited transfers, manual searches)
- **Total annual impact: $600K**

---

# CASE STUDY #3: FreshFlow Distribution
## "Real-Time Inventory Visibility for Perishables"

### Customer Background

**Company:** FreshFlow Distribution
**Industry:** Specialty Food & Perishable Distribution
**Size:** 180 employees, 3 cold storage facilities
**Location:** Portland, OR (headquarters)
**Market:** B2B perishable food distribution (wholesale to restaurants, retailers)
**Contract Value:** $35,000 ACV (2-year term)
**Signed:** Week 11 (Day 64)

---

### The Problem: Perishable Inventory Complexity

FreshFlow distributes specialty foods (imported cheeses, organic produce, artisanal meats) to 150+ restaurants and retailers. Perishable inventory presents unique challenges:

**Inventory & Freshness Crisis:**
- Temperature-sensitive inventory requiring precise tracking
- Expiration date management (thousands of SKUs with short shelf lives)
- Cross-location visibility needed (3 facilities spread across Oregon)
- Frequent write-offs (spoiled product due to inaccurate inventory = "phantom" spoilage)

**Operational Challenges:**
- Manual expiration date tracking (spreadsheets + sticky notes)
- Frequent product waste: 8-10% of inventory written off annually due to spoilage
- Customers receiving near-expiration products (damaging relationships)
- Complex fulfillment (pulling freshest product first requires manual sorting)

**Financial Impact:**
- Product spoilage/waste: $180K annually (8-10% of $2M inventory value)
- Lost customer relationships: $120K annually (customers switching to competitors)
- Labor inefficiency: 2.5 FTE on inventory management
- **Total annual impact: $300K+**

---

### Why They Chose TAI

**Key Differentiator:** Real-time inventory visibility + expiration tracking

**Competitive Evaluation:**
- Considered generic warehouse systems (no expiration tracking)
- Looked at food-specific systems (expensive, limited to large enterprises)
- TAI offered: Multi-location view, real-time visibility, temperature/expiration support, $35K price point
- **Decision:** TAI could be implemented in 60 days vs. 6+ months for competitors

**Executive Sponsor Quote:**
> "We've been managing expiration dates on spreadsheets for 10 years. TAI's real-time visibility means we can reduce spoilage by half overnight. The ROI on eliminating product waste alone justifies the investment."
>
> **— Elena Rodriguez, Operations Director, FreshFlow**

## Reference Calling Script

**Purpose:** Convert warm leads into customers by enabling references

**How It Works:**
1. Prospect says: "Can I talk to a customer?"
2. Sales says: "Absolutely. I'll intro you to Sarah Chen at MidCorp. She's implementing in your industry."
3. Reference call (30-45 min)
   - Customer shares their success story
   - Prospect gains confidence
   - Conversion rate: 60%+ (reference customers close deals)

**Talking Points for References:**
- "How was the 60-day implementation?"
- "What was the ROI you achieved?"
- "Were there any concerns during implementation? How did we handle them?"
- "Would you implement again? Why?"
- "What else should we have known before signing?"
- "Would you recommend TAI to other companies?"
