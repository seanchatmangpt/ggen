## FAQ: COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS

### Q: Why is Week 10 so critical?

**A**: Insurance is a non-negotiable blocker. Without professional liability insurance ($2M+), you cannot ethically or legally sign customer contracts. Week 10 establishes compliance credibility (insurance + SOC 2 audit) that enables Week 11-13 work.

---

### Q: Can we delay SOC 2 Type I?

**A**: No. Enterprise customers + Series A investors expect:
- Week 10: Audit initiated
- Week 13: Type I report delivered (or clear timeline)

Delaying signals disorganization to investors.

---

### Q: What if we don't have EU customers?

**A**: Confirm with all 3 customers first. If zero EU customers:
- Document exclusion: "No GDPR compliance required"
- Reduce timeline: Skip Item 2 entirely
- Cost savings: -$6-15K

But plan for future: If 4th customer is EU, implement GDPR before signing contract.

---

### Q: Who hires the CPA?

**A**: CEO should vet + hire by Week 10 Monday. Options:
1. Full-time in-house (expensive, overkill at this stage)
2. Part-time CPA firm (recommended, $2-5K/quarter)
3. Virtual CFO service (Forefront, Pilot, etc.)

---

### Q: How long does insurance binding take?

**A**: Same-day to 3 days after payment. Process:
1. Send RFP (Jan 26)
2. Receive quotes (Jan 28-29)
3. Select broker + negotiate (Jan 29-30)
4. Wire payment (Jan 31)
5. Receive certificate (within 1 hour)

---

### Q: Can we skip investor due diligence items?

**A**: No. Series A investors will ask for:
- Insurance certificate (binding proof)
- SOC 2 Type I report (security controls)
- Board minutes (governance)
- Tax returns (financial health)
- Compliance calendar (risk management)

Not having these = higher due diligence costs for them = you pay in valuation.

---

### Q: What if we discover a compliance gap in Week 12?

**A**: Escalate immediately:
1. Document the gap (what, why, impact)
2. Create mitigation plan (how to fix, timeline)
3. Communicate to board + investors transparently
4. Execute fix + document closure

Transparency > surprise. Investors appreciate finding issues early.

---

## GOVERNANCE & ESCALATION

### Weekly Escalation Path

**If any item goes RED**:
1. Report to CEO by end of day
2. Create remediation plan by next morning
3. Board notification by Friday
4. Investor transparency (if Series A in process)

**Escalation owners**:
- CEO: Day-to-day compliance
- Board: Strategic compliance (if advisory/formal board exists)
- Investors: Only if impacts fundraising

---

## NEXT STEPS (AFTER WEEK 13)

### Week 14+ (Planning)

1. **Extend SOC 2 to Type II** (12+ months of operation)
   - Timeline: Start planning by Q2 2026
   - Cost: $50-100K
   - Benefit: Enterprise contracts require Type II

2. **Expand to new markets** (if Series A funds it)
   - HIPAA (healthcare customers)
   - FERPA (education customers)
   - PCI DSS Level 3 (if in-house payment processing)

3. **Hire Chief Operating Officer** (scalability)
   - Timeline: Series A funding → hire by Month 18
   - Responsibility: All compliance + operations
   - Cost: $150-250K/year

4. **Establish Compliance Committee** (governance)
   - Members: CEO, CFO, General Counsel, Board rep
