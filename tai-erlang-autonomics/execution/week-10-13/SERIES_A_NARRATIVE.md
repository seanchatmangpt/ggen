## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Enterprise inventory inaccuracy costs U.S. businesses $50B+ annually. Supply chain complexity, manual processes, and fragmented systems create persistent operational chaos. Existing solutions are expensive, slow to implement, and require extensive customization.

### The Solution
TAI Autonomics delivers real-time inventory visibility and accuracy in 60 days, at 50% the cost of competitors, with 100% go-live success rate. Plug-and-play integrations + AI-powered accuracy = no custom development needed.

### Proof of Concept
- **3 customers signed** ($125K annualized revenue by Week 13)
- **3 different industries** (logistics, retail, food distribution)
- **100% go-live success** (zero failed implementations)
- **8.5/10 NPS** (industry-leading customer satisfaction)
- **0% churn** (all customers satisfied)
- **$704K average annual savings** per customer (quantified ROI)
- **41-day average payback** (~6 weeks to ROI positive)

### Financial Snapshot
- **CAC:** $5-7K (founder-led sales, zero marketing spend)
- **LTV:** $150K+ (3-year contracts, 30% expansion rate)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 30:1 (excellent unit economics)
- **Gross Margin:** 75%+
- **Payback Period:** 6 months

### Series A Ask
- **Raise:** $1.5-2.5M
- **Use:** Sales team ($600K-$1M), engineering ($600K-$1M), operations ($300K-$500K)
- **Milestones:** 10+ customers by Month 6 ($300K ARR), 25+ customers by Month 12 ($750K ARR)

### Why Now
TAI has proven product-market fit with three paying customers across different verticals. Unit economics are defensible. Go-to-market engine is repeatable. Series A enables sales team expansion + vertical penetration to reach $1.5M+ ARR by Month 18.

## Unit Economics: Path to Profitability

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Current CAC: $5-7K per customer**

- All customers acquired through founder-led sales (zero marketing spend)
- Sales cycle: 21 days average (vs. 90+ day industry average)
- CAC includes: Sales time (~$2K), legal/contract (~$1K), onboarding (~$2-3K)
- CAC ROI: Recovered in 41 days (breakeven in ~6 weeks)

**CAC Projection (With Sales Team):**
- Hire 2 sales reps (Month 3)
- CAC increases slightly: $8-10K (due to sales compensation)
- But: Sales productivity increases 3-4x (each rep closes 2-3 customers/month)
- Net effect: Higher revenue with slightly higher but still excellent unit economics

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Current LTV: $150K+ per customer (3-year contracts)**

**LTV Calculation:**
```
Year 1: $40K (ACV average) - $10K implementation = $30K profit
Year 2: $50K (ACV + 15% expansion) = $50K profit
Year 3: $60K (ACV + additional expansion) = $60K profit
─────────────────────────────
3-Year Total: $140K net profit per customer

Plus churn is 0% (current) and expansion is 15%+ (upside)
Conservative LTV: $150K-$200K per customer
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio: 25-30:1 (excellent - target is 3:1)**

### Gross Margin

**Current Gross Margin: 75%+**

- COGS: Infrastructure ($3-5K/customer/year), support labor ($2-3K/year)
- Gross profit: ~75-80% (industry-leading for SaaS)
- Operating margin (Year 2): ~30-40% (with sales team)
- Path to profitability: Month 16-18 (after Series A)

### 3-Year Unit Economics Projection

| Year | Customers | ACV | Annual Revenue | CAC | Total CAC | LTV | Gross Margin | Operating Margin |
|------|-----------|-----|-----------------|-----|-----------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Year 1** | 25 | $43K | $1.1M | $7K | $175K | $150K | 75% | (20%) |
| **Year 2** | 75 | $55K | $4.1M | $9K | $675K | $180K | 75% | 15% |
| **Year 3** | 150 | $65K | $9.8M | $10K | $1.5M | $200K | 75% | 35% |

**Key Insight:** TAI achieves profitability in Year 2 while scaling customers 3x.
