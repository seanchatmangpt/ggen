## Support & Updates

### How to Use These Documents

1. **First time:** Read COMPREHENSIVE_SCALING_SUMMARY.md for overview
2. **Planning:** Use WEEKLY_OPERATING_RHYTHM.md for meeting agendas
3. **Daily work:** Reference specific runbook (OPERATIONS_RUNBOOKS.md)
4. **Hiring:** Use HIRING_PLAN_UPDATED.md for recruiting
5. **Infrastructure:** Use WEEK_10_13_OPERATIONS_SCALING.md + INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY_ASSESSMENT.md
6. **Follow-up:** Update after each week (lessons learned → document improvements)

### Updating These Documents

After each week, update:
- [ ] KPI dashboard (actual vs. planned)
- [ ] Customer status (progress, issues)
- [ ] Hiring progress (candidates, offers)
- [ ] Infrastructure status (actual vs. planned)
- [ ] Lessons learned (what worked, what to change)

### Sharing with Team

- [ ] Copy all documents to team wiki (Notion, Confluence, etc.)
- [ ] Reference in Slack (link to specific sections)
- [ ] Print key runbooks for CSM/Sales desk
- [ ] Update weekly (keep documents living, not static)

---

## Final Notes

### Why This Works

1. **Comprehensive:** Addresses all 13 requirements (infrastructure, hiring, processes)
2. **Practical:** Every document has templates, checklists, timelines (not just theory)
3. **Executable:** Ready to use immediately (not "homework" to do later)
4. **Flexible:** Adjust to your situation (templates are starting points)
5. **Measurable:** Every plan has success criteria and metrics

### What Makes Scaling Hard (And How This Package Helps)

**Hard:** Coordinate 3 customers while hiring while scaling infrastructure
→ **Solution:** WEEKLY_OPERATING_RHYTHM.md (structured meetings keep team aligned)

**Hard:** Hire right people quickly while executing
→ **Solution:** HIRING_PLAN_UPDATED.md (recruiting playbook, ready to use)

**Hard:** Know if infrastructure will hold at 3 customers
→ **Solution:** INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY_ASSESSMENT.md (detailed analysis with fallback plans)

**Hard:** Remember what to do each week while moving fast
→ **Solution:** OPERATIONS_RUNBOOKS.md (copy-paste ready checklists)

**Hard:** Keep team and advisors updated with metrics
→ **Solution:** WEEKLY_OPERATING_RHYTHM.md + KPI dashboard (built-in reporting)

### One More Thing

**You don't need to be perfect.** These documents are guides, not gospel. Your team will adapt them as you learn. The goal isn't perfect compliance—the goal is **rapid, reliable scaling**.

- You'll discover new bottlenecks (great, add them to runbooks)
- Hiring will take longer or shorter (adjust timeline, keep recruiting)
- Customers will surprise you (update playbooks based on lessons)
- Infrastructure will scale differently (document what works, iterate)

This is all normal. **What matters is that you have a plan, you execute it, you measure results, and you adjust.** This package gives you that foundation.
