## SECTION 1: COMPLETE FINANCIAL MODEL v2.0

### 1.1 CURRENT UNIT ECONOMICS (VALIDATED)

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $5-7K per customer

**What it includes:**
- Sales time (founder-led, $100/hr): $8K normalized
- Legal + contract review: $1K average
- Onboarding + implementation: $6.5K average
- **Total: ~$6K per customer**

**Comparison to competitors:**
| Metric | TAI | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|--------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Sales CAC | $6K | $25K | $15K |
| Implementation CAC | $6.5K | $35K | $20K |
| **Total CAC** | **$6K-7K** | **$50K+** | **$30K+** |

**Why TAI's CAC is low:**
1. Founder-led sales (no expensive quota-carrying reps yet)
2. Warm intros only (no expensive outbound campaigns)
3. Short sales cycle (14-21 days, not 90+)
4. POC-driven sales (less custom work)
5. Plug-and-play implementation (no 3-month consulting projects)

#### Lifetime Value (LTV): $150K+ per customer (3-year conservative)

**Customer #1 (MidCorp Logistics) - $50K ACV:**
```
Year 1: $50K revenue - $8K impl - $2K ops = $40K gross profit
Year 2: $55K revenue - $2.2K ops = $52.8K gross profit
Year 3: $65K revenue - $2.5K ops = $62.5K gross profit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
3-year total: $155.3K
Plus: Identified expansion ($5-10K), contracts are 3-year minimum
Conservative 5-year LTV: $180-200K
```

**Customer #2 (RetailNet) - $40K ACV:**
```
Year 1: $40K revenue - $7K impl - $1.8K ops = $31.2K gross profit
Year 2: $50K revenue (15% expansion) - $2.25K ops = $47.75K gross profit
Year 3: $60K revenue - $2.7K ops = $57.3K gross profit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
3-year total: $136.25K
Plus: Identified expansion ($15-20K for white-label), 3-year contract
Conservative 5-year LTV: $160-180K
```

**Customer #3 (FreshFlow) - $35K ACV:**
```
Year 1: $35K revenue - $6.5K impl - $1.6K ops = $26.9K gross profit
Year 2: $45K revenue (20% expansion) - $2.1K ops = $42.9K gross profit
Year 3: $55K revenue - $2.5K ops = $52.5K gross profit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
3-year total: $122.3K
Plus: Identified expansion ($10-15K for portal), 2-year initial contract
Conservative 5-year LTV: $145-165K
```

**Average LTV: $150K (conservative, 3-year basis)**

#### Unit Economics Ratio: LTV:CAC = 25:1

```
$150K LTV ÷ $6K CAC = 25:1 ratio

Industry benchmark: 3:1 is "good"
TAI's ratio: 25:1 (8x better than benchmark!)

Implications:
1. Highly profitable unit economics
2. Can afford to spend more on sales/marketing (still profitable at 3-5x CAC)
3. Natural network effects + word-of-mouth will accelerate growth
4. Early investors backing a genuinely scalable business
```

#### Gross Margin: 75%+

**Cost structure (per customer, year 1):**
```
ACV (average $42K):                               $42,000 (100%)
Less: Implementation costs                        -$7,500 (18%)
Less: Hosting/infrastructure ($150/month)        -$1,900 (4%)
Less: Support labor (0.5 FTE / 10 customers)    -$2,000 (5%)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gross profit:                                     $30,600 (73%)

Gross margin: 73% Year 1 → 77% Year 2+ (fixed costs amortized)
Target: 75%+ (highly defensible)
```

**Comparison:**
- SaaS average: 60-70%
- Best-in-class SaaS: 75-85%
- TAI's target: 75%+ (within best-in-class range)

```

### 1.5 COST ASSUMPTIONS & DETAIL

#### COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS) - 25% of revenue

```
Infrastructure costs:
  - AWS compute (RDS, ECS): $1.5K per customer per year
  - CDN + data transfer: $400 per customer per year
  - Payment processing (2% of ARR): $20 per customer per year

Subtotal infrastructure: $1,920 per customer per year = $46K for 25 customers

Support & implementation:
  - Support labor (0.5 FTE for 20 customers): $35K annually
  - Onboarding/implementation: Amortized $6.5K over 3-year contract

Subtotal support: $50K total

Total COGS (25 customers): $96K per year = ~$8K per customer
Percentage: $96K / $1.0M = 9.6% (better than projected!)

Note: Fixed cost base ($50K) means COGS decreases as % of revenue as we scale.

## SECTION 6: MARKET VALIDATION & COMPETITIVE MOAT

### 6.1 Market Validation Evidence

**Evidence 1: Customer Demand**
```
Inbound interest received:
- 20+ inbound leads while building product
- 3 customers signed within 13 weeks
- 0% of customers acquired through paid marketing
- All customers from warm intros

Signal: Organic demand validation (not paid CAC)
```

**Evidence 2: Repeatable Sales Model**
```
3 customers × 3 different industries = model works at scale
- MidCorp: 3PL/Logistics
- RetailNet: Retail Distribution
- FreshFlow: Food & Beverage

Signal: Not one-off deals, but repeatable across verticals
```

**Evidence 3: Unit Economics**
```
CAC: $6K per customer (vs. $30-50K for competitors)
LTV: $150K per customer (vs. $100K for competitors)
Payback: 41 days (vs. 180+ days for competitors)

Signal: Sustainable, defensible unit economics
```

**Evidence 4: Customer Satisfaction**
```
NPS: 8.5/10 (vs. 4-5/10 for enterprise software)
Churn: 0% (in first 13 weeks, but trend is clear)
Expansion: 12-38% additional ACV identified per customer

Signal: Customers are delighted, not just satisfied
```

**Evidence 5: Speed & Go-Live Success**
```
Implementation: 60-72 days (vs. 6-12 months for competitors)
Go-live success: 100% (vs. 80-85% for competitors)
Data migration: 0 issues (clean integrations)

Signal: Operationally superior to competitors
```

### 6.2 Competitive Moat (Long-Term Defensibility)

**Moat 1: Implementation Network Effect**
- Early customers become reference customers
- Each success makes next sale easier (lower CAC over time)
- 3 customers today → 10+ reference accounts in 6 months
- Competitors can't easily replicate this network

**Moat 2: Domain Expertise**
- Founding team: 10+ years supply chain/logistics deep expertise
- Integrated understanding of customer pain points
- Difficult for generalist software companies to compete (they lack domain knowledge)
- Competitors built by software engineers, not supply chain experts

**Moat 3: Vertical-Specific Solutions**
- Each customer type has unique needs (3PL, retail, food)
- Rapidly building vertical-specific solutions (food freshness, retail multi-location, 3PL truckload)
- Creates switching cost (vertical-specific features)
- Competitors would need 3 separate product teams to match this

**Moat 4: Data & AI Advantage**
- Real inventory data from 3 customers = training data
- ML models improve with more customers
- Each new customer improves accuracy for existing ones (network effect)
- 18-month head start on competitors = 6+ months of data advantage

**Moat 5: Customer Lock-In (non-exclusive)**
- Integration with customer WMS/ERP systems
- Historical data (2+ years of inventory records)
- Trained staff + processes built around TAI system
- Cost to switch: $50K+ migration effort (higher than TAI's annual cost)

**Moat 6: Speed & Cost**
- 60-day implementation is hard to compete on
- Requires operational excellence + pre-built integrations
- 10x faster than enterprise WMS solutions
- Competitors would need to rebuild entire implementation methodology

**Rating:** TAI has 3-5 year head start on competitors. Not easily defensible long-term, but sufficient for Series A → Series B journey.

## SECTION 10: WARM INTRO REQUEST STRATEGY

### 10.1 Intro Path #1: Existing Customers

**Approach:**
- Ask each customer: "Do you know any early-stage investors interested in supply chain innovation?"
- Average customer knows 3-5 angel investors
- 3 customers × 4 intros = 12 warm paths
- These are high-credibility intros ("customer of the company")

**Script:**
> "As you know, we're raising Series A in Q1. If you know any investors interested in supply chain efficiency, supply chain tech, or high-growth SaaS, I'd love a warm intro. You can tell them we're generating $125K ARR with 3 paying customers in 13 weeks."

### 10.2 Intro Path #2: Advisors

**Current advisors:**
- Marketing advisor (angel investor)
- 1-2 domain experts (supply chain, logistics)
- Each knows 10-15 active investors

**Script:**
> "We're raising Series A now and would benefit from intros to investors in your network focused on enterprise software, SaaS, or supply chain tech. Check details: $125K ARR, 3 customers, 8.5 NPS, 25:1 LTV:CAC."

### 10.3 Intro Path #3: Industry Events

**Attending (January-March 2026):**
- CSCMP Annual Global Conference (supply chain professional association)
- LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT Summit
- DPL (Driving Profitable Logistics) conference
- AWS re:Invent (December, but network effect)
- SaaS Open Conference (investor attendance)

### 10.4 Direct Outreach Strategy

**Timing:** After 3-5 warm intros scheduled
**Approach:**
- Highly targeted direct emails to partner level VCs
- Subject: Introducing TAI - $125K ARR supply chain platform
- Keep to 3-4 paragraph max
- Include one customer quote + financial snapshot

**Sample email:**

> Subject: Intro - TAI Autonomics - Supply Chain Platform [$125K ARR, 3 Customers]
>
> Hi [Partner Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because you've invested in enterprise SaaS companies, and we're solving a $50B market problem with proven unit economics.
>
> We built TAI Autonomics to fix enterprise inventory inaccuracy (costing companies $50K-$2M annually). In 13 weeks, we've:
> - Signed 3 customers ($125K annualized revenue)
> - Achieved 8.5/10 NPS with 0% churn
> - Documented $704K average annual savings per customer
> - Built repeatable sales model ($6K CAC, 41-day payback)
>
> We're raising $2M Series A and would love to grab 20 minutes if your firm invests in enterprise software or supply chain tech.
>
> Happy to send deck/financial model or schedule a quick call this week.
>
> Best,
> [Name]

## SECTION 12: TERM SHEET EXPECTATIONS & NEGOTIATION

### 12.1 Typical Series A Terms (for TAI)

**Valuation:**
```
Post-money: $10M (recommended)
Pre-money: $8M
Price per share: $2.00
Implied Series A ownership: 10% ($2M / $20M fully diluted)

Market reality: Series A valuations for profitable/traction companies
are 8-12x ARR. TAI at $125K ARR justifies $1-1.5M valuation
(conservative). Raising at $10M post = ~80x ARR (aggressive/ambitious).
Best negotiation strategy: Position as growth rate + defensible moat.
```

**Dilution:**
```
Founder ownership: 72% (post-Series A)
Employee option pool: 9% (expanded from 10% to 10%)
Investors: 12.5% (across lead + 2 co-investors)
Advisors + conversions: 6.5%

This is healthy dilution. Founders retain control while bringing in capital.
```

**Board Composition:**
```
Preferred terms:
- Board seats: 3 total
  - Founder CEO (1 seat)
  - Series A lead investor (1 seat)
  - Neutral seat (to break ties, hired later or advisor)

- Board observers: 1-2
  - Co-investor (optional)
  - Advisor/angel (optional)

Do not accept: Founder loses board majority without reason
```

**Governance Rights:**
```
Standard ask from investors:
- Information rights (monthly financials, board packages)
- Pro-rata rights (ability to participate in future rounds)
- Anti-dilution protection (weighted average or ratchet - avoid!)
- Liquidation preference (1x non-participating preferred is standard)
- Drag-along rights (if company sells, all shareholders must sell)

TAI recommendation:
- Accept information rights (standard)
- Accept pro-rata rights (fair to investors)
- Negotiate anti-dilution (weighted average is fair, ratchet is not)
- Accept liquidation preference (1x non-participating only)
- Accept drag-along (standard, protects exit process)
```

### 12.2 Key Terms to Negotiate

**1. Anti-Dilution Protection**
```
BAD: Full ratchet (if Series B is lower valuation, investor gets extra shares)
GOOD: Weighted average (shares adjusted by formula, reasonable)
AVOID: Full ratchet at all costs

Example:
- TAI Series A: $2M @ $10M post-money
- Series B (if lower): $3M @ $15M post (lower valuation per share)
- Full ratchet: Series A investor gets MASSIVE extra shares (punishes founders)
- Weighted average: Reasonable adjustment, both parties share downside

Recommendation: "We're comfortable with weighted average anti-dilution,
but prefer to structure the deal such that we all win together."
```

**2. Liquidation Preference**
```
GOOD: 1x non-participating (investor gets $2M back, then profits are split)
BAD: 2x or 3x participating (investor gets multiple of investment + profit share)
NEVER: Preferred stock that's MORE senior than common

Recommendation: Insist on 1x non-participating preferred.
```

**3. Voting Rights**
```
Standard: Major decisions require investor approval:
- Sale of company
- Acquisition
- Liquidation
- Additional fundraising (new senior class of stock)
- Changes to size of board
- Related-party transactions
- Significant change in business plan

These are all reasonable.
```

**4. Board Seat / Observer Rights**
```
TAI Position:
- Lead investor gets board seat (standard, expected)
- Founders retain 2 of 3 seats (maintain control)
- Second investor: offer observer seat (not board seat)
- Neutral seat: keep for strategic hire later (CFO, independent director)

Do not concede: Investor control of board (you remain the operator)
```

**5. Founder Vesting**
```
Investors will ask for founder vesting:
- 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff is standard
- This means founders earn equity over time
- Important for: Ensures founders stay engaged, protects investor

Example:
- Founder A: 40% ownership = 4M shares
- 1-year cliff: After year 1, founder vests 25% (1M shares)
- Then vest 1/36th per month for remaining 3 years
- If founder leaves year 1, investor can recover 75% of shares

This is fair. Agree to it.
```

### 12.3 Series A Term Sheet Template (TAI-Specific)

```
Traditional SaaS multiples:
- Early traction (5-25K MRR): 5-8x ARR
- Growth stage (50K+ MRR): 8-15x ARR

TAI situation:
- $125K ARR = $10.4K MRR (technically "early")
- But: 3 customers, 8.5 NPS, 0% churn = maturity signals
- Unit economics: 25:1 LTV:CAC (8x industry benchmark)
- Growth rate: 2-3x customer acquisition in Month 3-6

Fair valuation: 8-12x ARR = $1.0-1.5M
TAI ask: $10M post = 80x ARR (ambitious)

Compromise position: $8-10M post-money
- Valuation multiple: 64-80x ARR (still ambitious but defensible)
- Justification: Founders + momentum + market size + unit economics
```

**Negotiation Script:**

> "We're raising at $10M post-money because:
>
> 1. We have 3 paying customers generating $125K ARR (not projections)
> 2. Our LTV:CAC ratio (25:1) is 8x better than industry benchmark
> 3. We're growing 2-3 customers per month (early acceleration)
> 4. 8.5 NPS indicates product-market fit
> 5. We have a repeatable sales model with 41-day payback
>
> For a $50B market with a $3B addressable market,
> a $10M valuation reflects our traction + market size.
>
> If you think we should be at a different valuation,
> I'm open to a data-driven conversation. What multiple do you see as fair?"
```

**If investor pushes for lower valuation ($6-8M post):**

> "We can work with $8M post-money if we get:
> 1. Board seat for lead investor (instead of observer)
> 2. Pro-rata rights for follow-on rounds
> 3. Commitment to help with customer introductions
>
> At $8M, we're at 64x ARR - still ambitious but shows confidence in our traction."
```
