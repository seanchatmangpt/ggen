## RISK MITIGATION

### Execution Risks
1. **Sales cycle extends beyond 21 days**
   - Mitigation: Maintain founder-led sales, focus on warm intros only

2. **Investor feedback is negative**
   - Mitigation: Adjust valuation/terms, identify willing investors first

3. **Investor meeting pipeline dries up**
   - Mitigation: Parallel track customer success (grow to 4-5 customers while raising)

### Market Risks
1. **Competitors enter mid-market space**
   - Mitigation: Build moat (customer network, domain expertise), move fast to scale

2. **Investor sentiment shifts (economic downturn)**
   - Mitigation: Emphasize ROI (41-day payback), prove business model profitability
