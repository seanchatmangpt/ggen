# TAI Erlang Autonomics: Contingency Procedures
## Step-by-Step Playbooks for Risk Scenarios (Weeks 1-13)

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Active Contingency Plans
**Horizon:** 90-day execution (Weeks 1-13)

---

## Introduction

This document provides **specific, step-by-step procedures** for executing contingency plans when the 13 identified risks materialize. Each contingency is designed to be activated immediately (within 24-48 hours) to keep the business on track.

**Golden Rule:** Better to execute a contingency early and be wrong than to ignore warning signals and miss the 90-day milestone.

## CONTINGENCY 1: Market TAM Appears Smaller Than Expected

### Activation Trigger (Week 6-7)
- Cold outreach response rate drops below 3% (should be 5-7%)
- 3+ qualified prospects say "this is not a fit" in discovery
- First 3 POCs show weak economic value (<$100K annual pain)
- Segment analysis shows 80%+ "not a fit" rate in primary segments

### Immediate Response (24 Hours)

**Step 1: Diagnosis (2 hours)**
```
CEO + VP Sales emergency session
├─ Review past 20 discovery call transcripts
├─ Identify pattern: Is it...
│  ├─ Messaging problem? (not explaining value clearly)
│  ├─ Segment problem? (wrong customer profile)
│  └─ Problem problem? (pain isn't as acute as expected)
├─ Decision: Which category is it?
└─ → Next step depends on diagnosis
```

**Step 2: Immediate Outreach Test (4 hours)**
```
Launch micro-outreach experiment to test hypothesis
├─ If messaging issue:
│  ├─ Test new message to same segment
│  ├─ 50 emails with new positioning
│  ├─ Track response rate improvement
│  └─ If >5% response: Messaging fixed; scale up
├─ If segment issue:
│  ├─ Test alternative segments (e.g., mid-market SaaS)
│  ├─ 30 cold emails to new segment
│  ├─ Track discovery rate
│  └─ If >30% meetings: Segment is better; shift focus
└─ If problem issue:
   ├─ Interview 5 "not a fit" prospects
   ├─ "What would need to be true for us to work for you?"
   ├─ Document: What's the real problem?
   └─ Reset solution narrative based on feedback
```

**Step 3: Board Notification (1 hour)**
```
CEO calls lead investor
├─ Message: "Testing market assumptions; may need to pivot segments"
├─ Data: Share last week's call transcripts showing response
├─ Ask: "Any warm intros to alternative customer segments?"
└─ Timeline: "Clarity by end of Week 6; decision by Week 7"
```

### Mitigation Response (Week 6-7)

**If Messaging Issue Confirmed:**
```
ACTION: Rebrand positioning
├─ Step 1: Refine value prop (pain focus analysis)
│  ├─ 3 customer calls: "What's your #1 pain point?"
│  ├─ Identify top pain (e.g., "operational overhead" vs. "compliance")
│  └─ Build messaging around that pain (not features)
├─ Step 2: Update sales deck + discovery script
│  ├─ Reframe 5-minute elevator pitch
│  ├─ Test with 3 warm prospects (get feedback)
│  └─ Rollout to full outreach by Week 7
├─ Step 3: Monitor response rate weekly
│  └─ Target: Move from 3% to 6-8% by Week 9
└─ Projected impact: +100% response rate = more pipeline for Customer #2, #3
```

**If Segment Issue Confirmed:**
```
ACTION: Shift 60% effort to higher-response segment
├─ Step 1: Identify best-performing segment
│  ├─ Segments tested: Enterprise SaaS, Cloud Infra, Fintech
│  ├─ Response rates: 3%, 7%, 4%
│  └─ Winner: Cloud Infrastructure (go deep here)
├─ Step 2: Replan prospect list
│  ├─ Add 30 prospects from high-response segment
│  ├─ Shift outreach: 60% Cloud Infra, 40% others
│  └─ Target: Book 8 discovery calls/week in winning segment
├─ Step 3: Test positioning in winning segment
│  ├─ Frame message around their specific pain
│  ├─ "Multi-tenant entitlement at scale" (Cloud Infra pain)
│  └─ vs. "SKU overhead" (SaaS pain)
└─ Projected impact: Customer #2 + #3 from Cloud Infra (faster cycles)
```

**If Problem Issue Confirmed:**
```
ACTION: Reset customer targeting + solution narrative
├─ Step 1: Redefine ICP
│  ├─ 5 interviews: "What would make entitlement problems critical?"
│  ├─ Identify: $500K+/year pain threshold
│  ├─ New ICP: Companies with $10M+/year ops overhead
│  └─ Previous ICP may have been: $50K-100K pain (too small)
├─ Step 2: Pivot solution narrative
│  ├─ Old: "Reduce manual SKU management"
│  ├─ New: "[Your problem that emerged from interviews]"
│  ├─ Test with 5 warm prospects
│  └─ Document new value prop + business case
├─ Step 3: Adjust pricing + financial model
│  ├─ If pain is $500K+, can charge more (customers have budget)
│  ├─ Adjust ACV from $30K to $50K+ (higher pain = higher price)
│  └─ Update financial model + Series A narrative
└─ Projected impact: Better-fitting customers, faster sales cycles, higher ACV
```

### Escalation (If Problem Persists - Week 8)

**If After Week 7 Response Still <3%:**
```
DECISION TREE:

Q1: Is pipeline completely dead?
├─ YES → Go to CONTINGENCY: Pivot to Alternative Business Model
└─ NO → Continue diagnosing; try again

Q2: Is this a market problem or execution problem?
├─ Market: Total addressable market may be smaller than expected
│  └─ Action: Plan for smaller, more profitable business
│     ├─ Adjust Year 1 from $125K to $75K ARR
│     ├─ Focus on profitability (not growth)
│     └─ Extend Series A timeline or pursue alternative funding
├─ Execution: We're just not reaching right people
│  └─ Action: Hire experienced sales person or advisor
│     ├─ 2-week sprint: Hire interim VP Sales
│     ├─ Fresh eyes on prospect targeting
│     └─ 30-day intensive (Week 8-9) to validate market
└─ Next decision: Stick with plan or pivot?
```

### Fallback Revenue Model (If TAM Significantly Smaller)

**Scenario: TAM is 30-40% smaller than expected**

```
Current Plan (Large TAM):
├─ Year 1: 15 customers × $30K = $450K ARR
├─ Year 2: 60 customers × $30K = $1.8M ARR
└─ Series A: $5M at $20M valuation (12x revenue)

Alternative Plan (Smaller TAM, Higher Profitability):
├─ Year 1: 8 customers × $50K = $400K ARR (focus on higher-value segments)
├─ Year 2: 20 customers × $50K = $1M ARR (premium positioning)
├─ Year 3: 30+ customers × $50K = $1.5M ARR (maintained focus)
├─ Profitability: Month 16 (vs. Month 18 in original plan)
├─ Series A: $2M at $15M valuation (10x revenue; venture debt alternative)
└─ Key change: Compete on value, not volume
```

## CONTINGENCY 2: Competitor Enters Deal

### Activation Trigger (Week 6-10)
- Customer mentions "Salesforce asked about our entitlements"
- Customer puts decision on hold pending "vendor comparison"
- Customer creates RFP that includes competitor
- Deal stalls at evaluation stage; extends beyond 60 days

### Immediate Response (24 Hours)

**Step 1: Intelligence Gathering (2 hours)**
```
VP Sales calls customer
├─ Question 1: "What specifically is competitor offering?"
├─ Question 2: "What's your timeline for decision?"
├─ Question 3: "What's most important to you: speed, price, features?"
├─ Question 4: "Are you planning to evaluate both or choose one?"
├─ Goal: Understand competitive threat level + customer commitment
└─ Output: Customer response grid (saved in shared doc)
```

**Step 2: Positioning Development (2 hours)**
```
CEO + CTO + VP Sales strategy session
├─ Document competitor positioning
│  ├─ Features: What are they claiming?
│  ├─ Timeline: How long is their implementation?
│  ├─ Price: What are they charging (estimate)?
│  └─ Moat: What's their competitive advantage?
├─ Identify TAI advantages (at least 3)
│  ├─ Speed: We're 4-6 weeks faster (30 days vs. 90+ days)
│  ├─ Audit: Receipt ledger is cryptographic (not just event logs)
│  ├─ Cost: $50K/year vs. $200K+ enterprise licensing
│  └─ [Company-specific advantage]
├─ Create "competitive brief"
│  ├─ 1-page document: "Why TAI wins"
│  ├─ Talking points for VP Sales
│  └─ Slides for customer presentation
└─ Output: Competitive brief ready for delivery
```

**Step 3: Customer Commitment (4 hours)**
```
CEO + VP Sales emergency customer call
├─ Frame: "We want to make sure TAI is the right choice"
├─ Agenda:
│  ├─ 15 min: "Explain your evaluation process"
│  ├─ 15 min: "Here's why we're different from [Competitor]"
│  │  ├─ Show competitive brief
│  │  ├─ Demonstrate speed advantage
│  │  └─ Show audit trail advantage
│  ├─ 15 min: "What's important to you?"
│  └─ 15 min: "Here's what I propose..."
├─ Ask for commitment
│  ├─ Option A (BEST): "Sign LOI this week, we launch Week 8"
│  │  └─ Create urgency: "We have 5 Q1 spots; limited availability"
│  ├─ Option B: "Commit to 30-day pilot with us (independent of evaluation)"
│  │  └─ "Evaluate both if you want, but let's start with us"
│  └─ Option C (FALLBACK): "Let's schedule weekly syncs; I'll help navigate evaluation"
├─ Lock in next steps
│  ├─ "When can we talk again?" (should be within 3 days)
│  └─ "What information do you need from us?" (set clear path forward)
└─ Output: Customer commitment + next meeting scheduled
```

**Step 4: Board Update (1 hour)**
```
CEO notifies lead investor
├─ Message: "[Customer] received competitor offer; TAI competing in evaluation"
├─ Data:
│  ├─ Timeline: Decision by [date]
│  ├─ Competitive positioning: [summary]
│  └─ Win probability: [estimated %]
├─ Ask:
│  ├─ "Any advice on competitive strategy?"
│  ├─ "Can you help with introductions to references?" (social proof)
│  └─ "Should we adjust pricing/terms to win?"
└─ Timeline: "Update by [date]"
```

### Contingency Execution (Week 6-10)

**If Customer Chooses Competitor (Deal Lost):**
```
PLAYBOOK: Customer Lost to Competitor

Action 1: Understand why (24 hours)
├─ Schedule debrief call
├─ Ask: "What was most important in your decision?"
├─ Ask: "What could TAI have done differently?"
├─ Document: Competitive loss reasons (for pattern analysis)
├─ Document: Lessons learned (for future deals)
└─ Send: "Thanks for evaluating us; let's stay in touch"

Action 2: Pivot to Customer #2 (Week 8+)
├─ Customer #1 pipeline may not close; accelerate Customer #2
├─ Already have POC in progress with Customer #2?
│  ├─ YES: Accelerate to close by Week 9 (vs. Week 10)
│  └─ NO: Launch Customer #2 POC immediately (can close Week 10-11)
└─ Maintain Customer #1 relationship for 12-month follow-up

Action 3: Competitor Intelligence (ongoing)
├─ How did competitor position themselves?
├─ What was their weakness in customer's eyes?
├─ Can we improve our positioning based on this loss?
└─ Document learning: Competitive playbook for next deal

Fallback: If Customer #1 lost + no backup pipeline ready
├─ Declare "90-day milestone reset"
├─ New target: 2 customers (vs. 3) by Week 13
├─ Timeline: Customer #2 by Week 10, Customer #3 by Week 16
├─ Series A prep: "Strong first customer is better than 3 weak ones"
└─ Adjust Year 1 target: $75K (vs. $125K); still viable for funding
```

**If Customer Stays in Evaluation (Deal Stalls):**
```
PLAYBOOK: Deal Stalls in Evaluation

Activation trigger: Day 45+ without signature
├─ Customer still hasn't signed
├─ Competitor still in evaluation
├─ Timeline extending (initially 60 days → now 90+ days)

Action 1: Accelerated engagement (Week 8-9)
├─ Increase touch frequency
├─ Daily email updates: "Progress we're making"
│  ├─ Day 1: Feature we just launched
│  ├─ Day 2: Customer reference we added
│  ├─ Day 3: Benchmark we achieved
│  └─ Goal: Create FOMO ("everyone's moving forward without us")
├─ Weekly executive check-in
│  ├─ CEO calls customer sponsor
│  ├─ Message: "Checking in; any questions we can answer?"
│  └─ Ask: "When will you be ready to decide?"
└─ Create false scarcity: "We have capacity for Q1; Q2 will be full"

Action 2: Pricing/terms incentive (if needed)
├─ Option 1: "If you commit this week, 20% discount for Year 1"
├─ Option 2: "We'll handle implementation for free (worth $20K)"
├─ Option 3: "Month 1 free; pay starting month 2"
├─ Option 4: "Performance-based: We hit KPIs or we refund 50%"
├─ Choose: Least expensive option that wins deal
├─ Budget: Up to $10K discount acceptable (worth it for first customer)

Action 3: Decision forcing (if evaluation extends beyond Week 10)
├─ At Day 60: Final offer
│  ├─ "We need a decision by [specific date]"
│  ├─ "After that date, we'll move on to other opportunities"
│  └─ "This offer expires [date]"
├─ Create real consequence: Reduce availability
│  ├─ Tell customer: "Engineer is allocated to Customer #2 starting [date]"
│  ├─ "If you want to start Q1, you need to commit by [date]"
│  └─ Make urgency real (not artificial)
└─ Escalate: If still no decision, accept that deal may not happen

Action 4: Fallback scenario
├─ If deal doesn't close by Week 11:
│  ├─ Move to "Customer #2" status
│  ├─ Customer #1 becomes "Customer #3"
│  ├─ Proceed with whoever closes first
│  └─ Don't wait for indecisive customer
└─ Maintain relationship: "Let's revisit in 90 days"
```

## CONTINGENCY 3: Customer Implementation Crisis

### Activation Trigger (Week 8-10)
- Customer hits blocking bug during POC
- Customer integration takes >5 days (should be 1-2 days)
- Customer finds missing feature critical for go-live
- Customer has >5 support requests/week
- Customer satisfaction drops below 6/10

### Immediate Response (48 Hours)

**Step 1: Situation Assessment**
```
CSM calls customer + CTO

What's the problem?
├─ Bug? (system broken)
├─ Missing feature? (needs capability we don't have)
├─ Scope creep? (customer asking for more than agreed)
├─ Knowledge gap? (customer doesn't know how to use it)
└─ Integration issue? (technical mismatch on their end)

How urgent is it?
├─ Blocking go-live? (P0 - must fix immediately)
├─ Delaying go-live? (P1 - fix this week)
├─ Nice to have? (P2 - fix after go-live)
└─ [Decision tree for urgency level]

What's required to fix?
├─ Engineering effort: Hours/days needed?
├─ Customer effort: What do they need to do?
├─ Timeline: When can we resolve?
└─ Workaround: Is there a temporary solution?

Output: Assessment document (30 min)
```

**Step 2: Triage Response**
```
Based on assessment, activate response path:

IF BUG:
├─ Severity: Critical (production down) vs. Minor (non-blocking)
├─ Response: CTO owns; target fix <24 hours if critical
├─ Workaround: Can customer proceed with workaround? (if so, reduces urgency)
└─ Path: Fix + deploy + customer retesting

IF MISSING FEATURE:
├─ Is it in Phase 1 scope? (should be working)
│  ├─ YES → Bug in implementation; fix + redeploy
│  └─ NO → Out of scope; move to Phase 2
├─ Phase 2 timeline: "Available in 4 weeks post-launch"
├─ Workaround: "Can you proceed without this for 30 days?"
└─ Path: Commit to Phase 2 feature; get customer buy-in

IF SCOPE CREEP:
├─ Clarify: Was this in original scope?
│  ├─ YES → Deliver it (my mistake; we committed)
│  └─ NO → Nice-to-have for Phase 2
├─ Recommend: "Let's launch with core features, add this month 2"
├─ Value: "This gives us time to build it right"
└─ Path: Signed scope amendment; clear Phase 2 commitment

IF KNOWLEDGE GAP:
├─ Training: Do they understand how to use the feature?
├─ Documentation: Do we have clear guides?
├─ Support: Can CSM/engineer do hands-on training?
├─ Timeline: 2-4 hours of training usually solves
└─ Path: Schedule training session; confirm resolution

Output: Response plan + timeline (1 hour)
```

**Step 3: Crisis Response (Day 1)**
```
Execute crisis protocol if P0 (blocking go-live)

IF BUG (P0):
├─ CTO takes ownership (stops other work)
├─ Engineer assigned: Full-time on fix
├─ Timeline: Root cause + fix within 8 hours
├─ Testing: Reproduce + verify fix + customer retest
├─ Deployment: Goes to production within 24 hours
├─ Follow-up: Daily engineer check-in until stable

IF FEATURE (P0):
├─ Scope decision: Can we ship without this feature?
│  ├─ Option A: Remove feature; launch with MVP core (recommended)
│  ├─ Option B: Build feature emergency (1 week sprint)
│  ├─ Option C: Defer launch (extends timeline 2-4 weeks)
├─ Pick option with customer (transparency)
├─ Communicate decision: Email + meeting
└─ Document: Scope amendment (legal cover)

IF SCOPE (P0):
├─ CEO + customer call: "Is this truly blocking launch?"
├─ Honest answer: If not blocking, defer to Phase 2
├─ If truly blocking: Engineer estimates build time
├─ Decision: Can we build in 3 days? (launch with 4-day buffer)
├─ Timeline: Scope + estimate + decision (same day)
└─ Fallback: If >3 days, defer launch 1 week

Output: Decision + timeline + communication (same day)
```

### Contingency Execution (Week 9-11)

**If Implementation Runs 7+ Days Behind:**
```
PLAYBOOK: Implementation Overrun

Activation: Week 9, customer not yet live

Action 1: Root cause analysis (24 hours)
├─ Meeting: CEO + CTO + CSM + customer
├─ Question: "Why are we behind?"
├─ Options:
│  ├─ Bugs (system issues)
│  ├─ Scope creep (customer added requirements)
│  ├─ Resource gap (customer's team unavailable)
│  └─ Technical integration (harder than expected)
├─ Document: Specific blockers
└─ Output: Root cause + remedy

Action 2: Acceleration options (24 hours)
├─ Option A: Add resources (engineer)
│  ├─ "We can add a second engineer to parallelize work"
│  ├─ Cost: $200/hour × 40 hours = $8K
│  ├─ Benefit: Save 1 week (go live Week 10 vs. Week 11)
│  └─ ROI: Worth it for reference customer
├─ Option B: Reduce scope
│  ├─ "Launch with 80% of features; add 20% in month 2"
│  ├─ Cost: Customer must accept reduced functionality
│  ├─ Benefit: Go live on original timeline
│  └─ Success criteria: Core features work perfectly
├─ Option C: Extend timeline
│  ├─ "We'll go live in 3 weeks instead of 2"
│  ├─ Cost: Delays Customer #2, #3 pipeline
│  ├─ Benefit: Higher quality go-live; less risk
│  └─ Impact: May miss Week 13 revenue milestone (acceptable)
├─ Recommend: Option A + B combo
│  ├─ Add engineer (week 9-10); build missing feature
│  ├─ Remove phase 2 nice-to-haves; go live with core
│  └─ Target: Live in 10 days (reduced scope + extra resources)
└─ Decision: Present options to customer; let them choose

Action 3: Customer communication (same day)
├─ CEO → Customer CEO/Sponsor call

├─ Support: "I'm personally overseeing this"
└─ Result: Customer appreciation for honesty + aggressive commitment

Action 4: Aggressive execution (Week 10)
├─ Daily standups: 15 min, same time
├─ CSM = dedicated 1 FTE to customer #1 (nothing else)
├─ Engineer = 100% focused on blocker
├─ Any new blockers? (escalate immediately)
├─ CTO on-call: If engineer gets stuck, CTO jumps in
└─ Target: Clear all blockers by end of week

Action 5: Go-live (Week 11 or earlier)
├─ Pre-launch checklist: All systems tested
├─ Customer training: 4-hour session (CSM + CTO)
├─ Go-live support: 24/7 availability (Week 1)
├─ Daily health checks: "Any issues?"
└─ Success criteria: System stable + customer happy

Output: Timeline commitment + aggressive execution
```

**If Customer Becomes Unhappy (Satisfaction <6/10):**
```
PLAYBOOK: Save Customer Relationship

Activation trigger: NPS or satisfaction feedback <6/10

Action 1: Root cause interview (24 hours)
├─ CSM + CTO call
├─ Listen: "Tell us what's not working"
├─ Document: Specific complaints
├─ Classify:
│  ├─ Product issue (system doesn't work)
│  ├─ Process issue (implementation is painful)
│  ├─ Communication issue (we're not listening)
│  └─ Expectation issue (product not what they expected)
├─ Don't defend; just listen
└─ Output: Complaint summary

Action 2: Fix commitment (24 hours)
├─ CEO + customer CEO call
├─ Acknowledge: "We understand your frustration"
├─ Take ownership: "Here's what we're fixing"
├─ Commit: Specific improvements + timeline
├─ Example commitments:
│  ├─ Product: "Bug fixed by [date]"
│  ├─ Process: "You'll have dedicated support 24/7"
│  ├─ Communication: "Daily check-ins until resolved"
│  └─ Expectation: "Here's what we'll deliver"
├─ Timeline: "We'll be at 8/10 satisfaction by [date]"
└─ Output: Recovery plan

Action 3: Intense support phase (Week 10-11)
├─ Daily check-ins: CSM calls customer daily (15 min)
├─ Proactive fixes: We identify + fix issues before customer reports
├─ Escalation: Any blocker → CTO involved within 4 hours
├─ Transparency: Weekly update on fixes + progress
├─ Success metric: Satisfaction improves by 2+ points/week
└─ Target: Get back to 7-8/10 by go-live

Action 4: Go-live excellence (Week 11)
├─ Perfect execution: Customer feels supported
├─ Result: Customer becomes advocate ("They went above & beyond")
├─ Outcome: Reference case study (how we saved a relationship)
└─ Long-term: Customer becomes strong reference + upsell opportunity

Output: Recovery plan + daily progress tracking
```

## CONTINGENCY 4: Burn Rate Exceeds $42K/Month

### Activation Trigger (Week 5+)
- Weekly cash tracking shows average >$42K/month
- Projected runway <10 months
- GCP infrastructure bills 20%+ higher than modeled
- Recruiting firm quotes are 30%+ higher than expected
- Unplanned expenses (legal, insurance, audit) emerge

### Immediate Response (48 Hours)

**Step 1: Cost Analysis**
```
CFO + CEO review (4 hours)

Spend breakdown:
├─ Payroll: [current]
├─ Cloud infrastructure: [current]
├─ Marketing: [current]
├─ Legal/compliance: [current]
├─ Tools/subscriptions: [current]
└─ Miscellaneous: [current]

For each category >budget:
├─ Reason: Why is it over?
├─ Duration: Is it one-time or recurring?
├─ Levers: What can we cut?
└─ Impact: How much can we save?

Output: Cost reduction roadmap (1 hour)
```

**Step 2: Immediate Cost Cuts (Target: $8-10K reduction)**
```
Quick wins (implement within 1 week):

GCP Negotiation (Target: -$5K/month, 20% discount):
├─ Call: GCP startup rep (they want to help)
├─ Pitch: "We're pre-Series A; need discount to scale"
├─ Ask: Enterprise discount (typical: 20-25%)
├─ Timeline: Decision within 3-5 days
└─ Impact: $5-6K/month savings

Tool consolidation (Target: -$2K/month):
├─ Audit: What SaaS tools are we paying for?
│  ├─ Slack: $8/person × 10 people = $80/month
│  ├─ Notion: $10/person × 5 = $50/month
│  ├─ Datadog: $5-15K depending on usage
│  ├─ Stripe: % of revenue
│  └─ Other: [list all]
├─ Cuts:
│  ├─ Downgrade: Datadog to free tier (-$2K)
│  ├─ Cancel: Unused tools (-$500)
│  └─ Consolidate: Use open-source where possible (-$500)
└─ Impact: $3K/month savings

Hiring pause (Target: -$5K/month defer):
├─ Defer CSM hire: Start Week 8 instead of Week 6 (-$5K)
├─ Defer backend: Use contractor instead of hire (-$0, already planned)
├─ Defer marketing: Focus on organic only (-$2K)
└─ Impact: -$5-7K/month in deferred spending

Total quick wins: $8-13K/month reduction (target met)
```

**Step 3: Board Communication (1 hour)**
```
CEO calls lead investor

Message: "We're optimizing cost structure; runway extended 2 months"

Data:
├─ Previous burn: $42K/month
├─ Optimized burn: $35K/month
├─ Runway: 10 months → 12 months
└─ Levers: GCP discount + tool optimization + hiring pause

Ask:
├─ "GCP discount good idea?" (validate strategy)
├─ "Any other cost cuts we should consider?"
└─ "Will this impact Series A discussions?" (stay aligned)

Outcome: Board aware + supportive
```

### Contingency Execution (Week 6+)

**If Cost Cuts Can't Bring Burn Below $38K/Month:**
```
PLAYBOOK: Severe Cost Reduction (Plan B)

Activation: GCP discount denied OR tools already minimal OR hiring already frozen

Action 1: Payroll review (most likely lever)
├─ Payroll typically 60-70% of burn
├─ Options:
│  ├─ Option A: Reduce contractor hours (20% reduction)
│  │  ├─ Backend engineer: $12K/month → $10K/month (-$2K)
│  │  ├─ Impact: Slower feature development
│  │  └─ Mitigation: Prioritize critical path features only
│  ├─ Option B: Reduce founder salary (temporary)
│  │  ├─ CEO salary: $10K/month → $5K/month (-$5K)
│  │  ├─ Why: Runway extension buys time for revenue
│  │  └─ Duration: Until first revenue (Week 7-10)
│  ├─ Option C: Defer hire (CSM, engineer #2)
│  │  ├─ Defer CSM: Week 6 → Week 10 (-$4K)
│  │  ├─ Defer Backend: Contract instead of hire (-$2K)
│  │  └─ Impact: Slower customer success + implementation
│  └─ Recommend: Combo approach
│     ├─ CEO salary reduction: -$5K
│     ├─ Contractor reduction: -$2K
│     ├─ CSM hiring deferral: -$4K
│     └─ Total: -$11K/month (burn to $31K)

Action 2: Revenue acceleration (only real solution)
├─ Aggressive sales: Each $50K revenue closes 1.5-month runway gap
├─ Strategy: Close Customer #1 in Week 7 (get $30K recurring)
│  ├─ $30K MRR = $360K ARR
│  ├─ 1.5-month cash benefit per deal
│  └─ Customer #2 (Week 8-9) = additional 1.5 months
├─ Target: $150K revenue by Week 13 (vs. $125K plan)
│  ├─ 3 customers × $40-50K average ACV
│  ├─ Provides 2-month runway buffer
│  └─ Buys time for Series A + improves negotiating position
└─ Path: Make sales the #1 priority (CEO + VP Sales focus)

Action 3: Board discussion: Bridge financing?
├─ If burn remains >$38K + runway <10 months:
├─ Options:
│  ├─ $100K bridge round from existing investors
│  │  ├─ 3-month extension (buys time for Series A)
│  │  ├─ Terms: SAFE with Series A discount
│  │  └─ Timeline: Can raise in 1-2 weeks
│  ├─ Revenue-based financing (Stripe, Brex)
│  │  ├─ Available post-revenue
│  │  ├─ $100-200K possible on $30K MRR
│  │  └─ 6-8% of revenue repayment
│  └─ Venture debt (SVB, Hercules)
│     ├─ Requires Series A LOI
│     ├─ $300-500K possible
│     └─ 4-5% interest + 0.5% warrant coverage
├─ CEO decision: How aggressive do we need to be?
└─ Path: Activate bridge if needed (Week 6)

Output: Cost reduction plan + revenue acceleration + potential bridge
```

**If Series A Funding Becomes Uncertain:**
```
PLAYBOOK: Extended Runway Planning

Activation: 10-month runway + Series A timeline uncertain

Action 1: Plan for 24-month runway (vs. 12-month)
├─ Adjust burn: Must get to $20-25K/month (profitable)
├─ Revenue required: $50K+ MRR (to support burn)
├─ Timeline: Reach $50K MRR by Month 12-15
├─ Path:
│  ├─ 3 customers by Week 13 ($30-40K MRR)
│  ├─ 6-8 customers by Month 6 ($50K+ MRR)
│  └─ Profitability by Month 16-18 (no external funding needed)
└─ Strategy: Pivot from growth to sustainable business model

Action 2: Alternative funding tiers
├─ Tier 1 (Ideal): Series A at $20M+ valuation
│  └─ Timing: If capital markets strong, pursue (June 2026)
├─ Tier 2 (Acceptable): Seed extension from existing investors
│  ├─ Amount: $250-500K bridge
│  ├─ Timing: If Series A delayed 3+ months
│  └─ Terms: SAFE with Series A discount + warrant coverage
├─ Tier 3 (Plan C): Revenue-based financing
│  ├─ Amount: $100-300K on revenue
│  ├─ Available: Once we hit $30K MRR
│  └─ Terms: 6-8% revenue share for 24-36 months
└─ Decision: Pursue aggressively in this order

Action 3: Profitability pathway
├─ Target: Profitability by Month 18 (no Series A needed)
├─ Model:
│  ├─ Month 12: $50K MRR (8-10 customers)
│  ├─ Month 15: $70K MRR (12-15 customers)
│  ├─ Month 18: $80-100K MRR (breakeven + growth)
│  └─ From there: Self-sustaining growth
├─ Key: Focus on profitability metrics
│  ├─ CAC < $3.5K
│  ├─ LTV/CAC > 100x
│  ├─ Payback period < 12 months
│  └─ Churn < 5%
└─ Path: If Series A doesn't happen, still healthy business by Month 18

Output: 24-month runway plan + alternative funding strategy
```

## CONTINGENCY 5: Key Team Member Departure

### Activation Trigger (Week 1-13)
- Key person (CTO, VP Sales, Founder) resigns
- Key person signals dissatisfaction or explores other options
- Key person takes emergency leave (health, family)
- Team conflict emerges; one person must leave

### Immediate Response (24 Hours)

**Step 1: Retention Attempt (if person signals first)**
```
If person is still considering:

CEO 1:1 call (first hour)
├─ Listen first: "Talk me through what you're thinking"
├─ Understand: What's the real issue?
│  ├─ Compensation? (raise it)
│  ├─ Role clarity? (redefine role)
│  ├─ Team friction? (resolve conflict)
│  ├─ Product direction? (align on strategy)
│  └─ Personal? (acknowledge + provide flexibility)
├─ Counter-offer options:
│  ├─ Option A: Refresh equity (new grant at higher valuation)
│  ├─ Option B: Compensation increase (10-20% raise)
│  ├─ Option C: New role (address dissatisfaction)
│  ├─ Option D: Flexibility (work schedule, location)
│  └─ Combo: Multiple levers to make person want to stay
├─ Timeline: Decision within 24 hours
└─ Outcome: Person stays OR person commits to transition plan

If person stays:
├─ Document: What changed (equity refresh, raise, role change)
├─ Follow-up: Weekly check-ins next month (ensure satisfaction)
└─ Address root cause: Don't let same issue resurface

If person leaving:
├─ Request: 4-week notice (with transition support)
├─ Plan: Knowledge transfer schedule (see below)
└─ Outcome: Orderly transition
```

**Step 2: Backup Hiring (if person leaves)**
```
Activation: Person has resigned or is unresponsive

Action 1: Emergency recruiting (same day)
├─ Identify role: CTO, VP Sales, or other key person
├─ Activate backup plan:
│  ├─ Fast-track finalist candidate (if pre-identified, Week 2-6)
│  ├─ Call candidate: "Is this still of interest?"
│  ├─ Expedited interview: Offer decision by week-end
│  ├─ Offer package: Competitive + equity + urgency bonus
│  └─ Target: Acceptance within 48 hours
├─ If no backup candidate:
│  ├─ Call recruiting firm (rush search)
│  ├─ Brief: "We need someone ASAP; role starts immediately"
│  ├─ Target: 3 final candidates by Day 3
│  ├─ Interviews: Day 4
│  ├─ Offer: Day 5
│  └─ Start: ASAP (Week 1-2)
├─ Bonus: Consider offering signing bonus ($10-20K) for quick availability
└─ Timeline: New person starts within 2-3 weeks (overlap with departing person 1 week)

Action 2: Knowledge transfer (Week 1-3 of departure)
├─ Schedule: 5 × 4-hour sessions with departing person
├─ Session 1: System architecture + code overview
├─ Session 2: Database schema + API design
├─ Session 3: Deployment + monitoring setup
├─ Session 4: Customer relationships + contracts
├─ Session 5: Roadmap + next priorities
├─ Documentation: Departing person writes/updates key docs
├─ Pairing: New person shadowing during handoff
└─ Target: 80% knowledge transfer by week 3

Action 3: Business continuity (Week 1+)
├─ Don't lose momentum:
│  ├─ Assign deputy (interim fill) for 2 weeks
│  ├─ CTO departure? → Interim CTO (senior engineer acts) until new hire
│  ├─ VP Sales departure? → CEO acts as interim + investor helps
│  └─ Other role? → Team lead fills temporarily
├─ Keep projects moving:
│  ├─ Prioritize: What MUST happen this month?
│  ├─ Defer: What can wait until new hire ramps?
│  └─ Resource: Bring in contractor if needed (cost-justified for critical work)
└─ Timeline: Keep velocity consistent (no more than 20% slowdown)

Output: New hire committed + transition plan + interim coverage
```

### Contingency Execution (Week of Departure)

**If CTO Departs:**
```
PLAYBOOK: CTO Replacement

Immediate actions (Day 1):
├─ Notify board: "CTO departing; transition plan activated"
├─ Activate recruiting: Fast-track finalists or rush search
├─ Announce to team: "We're bringing in strong replacement; stay focused"
└─ Transition: Assign interim CTO (senior engineer)

What interim CTO handles (2-3 weeks):
├─ Production issues: On-call for system stability
├─ Critical bugs: Triage + prioritize
├─ Architecture decisions: Continue roadmap work
├─ Customer escalations: Technical problem-solving
└─ New hire onboarding: Prepare for transition

What gets deferred:
├─ Major refactoring: Pause until new CTO arrives
├─ New infrastructure: Defer 2-3 weeks
├─ Architecture rewrites: Postpone
└─ Feature development: Reduce 30% (focus on critical path only)

Timeline:
├─ Week 1: Knowledge transfer begins
├─ Week 2: New CTO hired (offer accepted)
├─ Week 3: New CTO starts + overlaps with departing CTO
├─ Week 4: Departing CTO leaves; new CTO ramping
└─ Week 5-6: New CTO productive; back to full speed

Impact on execution:
├─ Customer #1 implementation: Slight delay possible (manage expectations)
├─ MVP delivery: 1-2 week delay acceptable
├─ Series A timeline: Unchanged (Series A not until Month 6)
└─ Overall: Minimal impact if transition smooth

Hiring priorities for new CTO:
├─ Experience: 5+ years, production Erlang/BEAM preferred
├─ Leadership: Has led engineering teams before
├─ Ship mentality: Can deliver MVPs fast (not perfectionist)
├─ Communication: Can explain technical to non-technical
└─ Compensation: $150-200K + 2-3% equity (competitive for market)
```

**If VP Sales Departs:**
```
PLAYBOOK: VP Sales Replacement

Immediate actions (Day 1):
├─ Notify board: "VP Sales departing; interim coverage activated"
├─ CEO acts as interim: Takes customer calls + sales strategy
├─ Board help: Ask advisor for introductions to qualified salespeople
├─ Freeze: No new outreach (preserve pipeline state) for 5 days

What CEO does (2-3 weeks):
├─ Customer calls: Maintain relationships with prospects in pipeline
├─ Deal closing: Focus on Week 7 signature (Customer #1)
├─ Outreach: Continue cold calls (don't slow momentum)
├─ Strategy: Work on positioning + competitive response
└─ Team: Keep sales team motivated ("I'm stepping in; we're fine")

What gets deferred:
├─ New campaigns: Pause new outreach initiatives (focus on current pipeline)
├─ Marketing: Defer content/PPC (organic only for 3 weeks)
└─ Events: Postpone conferences/events

Timeline:
├─ Week 1: CEO acts as interim + recruiting begins
├─ Week 2: Final candidates identified
├─ Week 3: New VP Sales hired (offer accepted)
├─ Week 4: New VP Sales starts + learns pipeline
├─ Week 5-6: New VP Sales productive; hitting numbers
└─ Impact: 2-3 week slowdown in new outreach (acceptable)

Hiring for replacement VP Sales:
├─ Experience: 3-5 years SaaS sales; quota attainment track record
├─ Segment expertise: B2B SaaS or enterprise preferred
├─ Self-starter: Can work independently (CEO can't hold hand)
├─ Resilience: Comfortable with early-stage (non-branded)
└─ Compensation: $80-120K salary + significant commission/equity

Key handoff docs (to preserve knowledge):
├─ Prospect list: Names + notes + stage + next step
├─ Call scripts: Positioning + discovery questions
├─ Competitive brief: How to respond to competitor objections
├─ Customer interviews: Notes from 20+ calls
└─ Pipeline forecast: Q1 deals + probability

Impact on execution:
├─ Customer #1 signature: Might slip 1 week (minimize impact)
├─ Customer #2, #3: May take 2-3 weeks longer to close
├─ Overall timeline: 2-3 week slip acceptable; still hit Week 13 milestone
└─ Key: Don't lose momentum; CEO + interim team keep pipeline moving
```

**If Founder Departs:**
```
PLAYBOOK: Founder Replacement (Rare, but High Impact)

If this happens:
├─ It's usually a fundamental issue (team misalignment, personal crisis)
├─ Board must decide: Can we continue? Or shut down?

If decision is to continue:
├─ Promote: Interim CEO from CTO or VP Sales
├─ Board support: Investor takes more operational role
├─ Stability: Clear communication to team + customers + investors
├─ Hiring: Plan to hire experienced CEO (Month 4-6)
└─ Timeline: High impact; expect 4+ week delay to milestones

If decision is to raise capital for new CEO:
├─ Plan: Quick capital raise to hire strong CEO
├─ Valuation: Down-round expected (founder departure is negative signal)
├─ Timeline: 4-6 week process
└─ Impact: Delays execution 2-3 months; focuses on finding leader

This is a nuclear scenario; activate board oversight + advisor support
```

## CONTINGENCY 6: Production System Incident

### Activation Trigger (Week 8-13)
- Production downtime >10 minutes
- Data integrity issue detected
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance degradation (p99 latency >200ms)
- Audit trail corruption detected

### Immediate Response (First Hour)

**Step 1: Incident Declared (0-15 min)**
```
When incident detected:
├─ Page on-call engineer (Slack alert)
├─ Create incident channel: #incident-[date]
├─ Declare: "We have a P0 incident"
├─ Notify: Incident commander (CTO) + communications lead (CEO)
└─ Start clock: Incident duration tracking

Incident commander duties:
├─ Technical diagnosis (What went wrong?)
├─ Severity assessment (P0/P1/P2)
├─ Resource mobilization (Who needs to help?)
└─ Timeline tracking (When will it be fixed?)

Communications lead duties:
├─ Affected customer notification (within 15 min if P0)
├─ Message: "Incident description + ETA to fix"
├─ Frequency: Updates every 30 min if P0
└─ Transparency: Be honest about status
```

**Step 2: Investigation & Triage (15-45 min)**
```
CTO + Engineer investigation

What happened?
├─ Was it a deployment? (Check last 24 hours)
├─ Was it database? (Check query logs)
├─ Was it infrastructure? (Check GCP dashboard)
├─ Was it code? (Check error logs)
└─ Was it traffic spike? (Check metrics)

How severe?
├─ P0: Data loss OR production down OR audit trail broken
│  └─ All hands; swarm the issue; stop all other work
├─ P1: Service degraded OR critical feature down
│  └─ Senior engineer; normal escalation path
├─ P2: Minor feature broken OR non-critical system
│  └─ Normal triage; fix within business hours

What's the fix?
├─ Code bug? (rollback vs. hot-fix decision)
├─ Database? (restore from backup vs. manual repair)
├─ Infrastructure? (failover vs. repair)
└─ Data? (validation + remediation)

Timeline to fix?
├─ P0: 1-4 hours (target: 30 min - 2 hours)
├─ P1: 24 hours
├─ P2: 48 hours
└─ Communicate ETA to customer
```

**Step 3: Resolution (45 min - 4 hours)**
```
Execute fix based on severity

IF CODE BUG (Most common):
├─ Rollback vs. Hot fix decision?
│  ├─ Rollback: Revert to known good version (5-10 min total)
│  │  ├─ Fastest path to stability
│  │  ├─ Risk: Lose some recent data (acceptable if <1 min)
│  │  └─ Recommended: If no quick fix available
│  └─ Hot fix: Develop + test + deploy fix (30 min - 2 hours)
│     ├─ Preserve data (if applicable)
│     ├─ Requires: Careful testing before deploy
│     └─ Recommended: If rollback would lose critical data
├─ Testing: Verify fix works in production (use canary if available)
└─ Monitor: Watch metrics for 30 min post-fix

IF DATABASE ISSUE:
├─ Backup restore: (30 min - 1 hour)
│  ├─ Restore from most recent backup
│  ├─ Data loss: Acceptable if <1 hour of transactions
│  └─ Verify: Run consistency checks post-restore
├─ Manual repair: (1 hour - 4 hours)
│  ├─ If specific records corrupted (not full database)
│  ├─ Identify bad records + repair/delete them
│  └─ Verify: Audit trail still consistent

IF INFRASTRUCTURE:
├─ Failover: Switch to backup (if available) (5-15 min)
├─ Restart: Reboot + monitor recovery (10-30 min)
└─ Scale: Add resources if overloaded (15-30 min)

IF DATA CORRUPTION:
├─ Forensics: Understand what was corrupted
├─ Remediation: Fix the corrupted data
├─ Audit trail: Verify integrity with hash checks
└─ Timeline: Can be hours-long investigation (customer aware)
```

**Step 4: Customer Notification (Ongoing)**
```
Communicate with customer throughout incident

Message template:

INITIAL (within 15 min):
"We're experiencing [issue]. Our team is investigating. ETA to fix: [time]. We'll update in 30 min."

EVERY 30 MIN (if still ongoing):
"Still investigating. Here's what we've found: [status]. New ETA: [time]."

RESOLUTION:
"Incident resolved at [time]. Duration: [X minutes]. Root cause: [brief explanation]. Action items: [what we'll do to prevent]."

POST-INCIDENT (24 hours):
"Full incident report available: [link]. We're taking [actions] to prevent recurrence."

Key principles:
├─ Be honest: Don't minimize or exaggerate
├─ Be specific: Explain what happened (in customer terms)
├─ Be accountable: Own the issue; don't blame others
└─ Be proactive: Tell them what we're doing to fix it
```

### Post-Incident (After Resolution)

**Step 1: Immediate Actions (Day of Incident)**
```
Postmortem meeting (within 4 hours of fix)

Attendees: Engineer + CTO + CEO
├─ What happened? (Technical details)
├─ Why did it happen? (Root cause)
├─ Why didn't we catch it? (Detection gap)
├─ How do we prevent it? (Process change)
└─ Timeline: Issue detected → fix deployed

Output: 1-page postmortem
├─ Incident description
├─ Root cause (clear + specific)
├─ Resolution steps
├─ Follow-up action items + owner + deadline
└─ Share with team + board
```

**Step 2: Preventive Actions (Day 1-3 Post-Incident)**
```
For code bug:
├─ Add test case that would catch this bug
├─ Add monitoring/alert for similar issues
├─ Code review process improvement (if applicable)
└─ Regression testing before next deployment

For database issue:
├─ Improve backup/restore testing
├─ Add data validation checks
├─ Monitoring for corruption patterns
└─ Runbook for recovery documented

For infrastructure issue:
├─ Add autoscaling/failover
├─ Improve monitoring + alerting
├─ Capacity planning review
└─ Redundancy improvements

Timeline: Most preventive actions done within 48 hours
```

**Step 3: Customer Follow-Up (Day 1-2 Post-Incident)**
```
CEO → Customer call (24 hours after resolution)

Agenda:
├─ Apology: "We take responsibility for the incident"
├─ Explanation: "Here's what happened (in plain English)"
├─ Prevention: "Here's what we're doing to prevent this"
├─ Compensation: "As a gesture of goodwill, [offer]"
│  ├─ 1 month free service ($4-6K)
│  ├─ Additional implementation support
│  └─ Direct access to CTO (if future issues)
├─ Confidence: "We've made [X improvements]; this won't happen again"
└─ Relationship: "Thanks for trusting us; we're committed to your success"

Goal: Turn incident into proof that we care + take responsibility
```

## CONTINGENCY 7: Customer Compliance Blocker

### Activation Trigger (Week 6-9)
- Customer auditor says "this doesn't meet SOC 2"
- Customer lawyer rejects DPA (data processing agreement)
- Insurance company won't cover our service
- Customer says "we need SOC 2 Type II certification"

### Immediate Response (48 Hours)

**Step 1: Problem Assessment**
```
CEO + Legal + CTO call

What's the specific issue?
├─ SOC 2 Type II requirement? (audit certification)
├─ DPA requirement? (compliance with data laws)
├─ Insurance requirement? (liability coverage)
├─ Audit trail requirement? (meets audit standards)
└─ Other? (identify specifically)

Is it blocking or "nice to have"?
├─ Blocking: Customer can't sign without it
├─ Nice to have: Auditor would prefer it
├─ Document: Get customer to clarify importance

Can we address it?
├─ Insurance: Can we switch carriers or offer alternative?
├─ Audit: Can we pass with documentation vs. formal certification?
├─ DPA: Can we modify language to address concern?
└─ Process: How much effort to fix?

Output: Issue + urgency + effort estimate
```

**Step 2: Solution Options (24 hours)**
```
Three options to present to customer:

OPTION A: "We'll fix it"
├─ Cost: Engineering time + certification cost ($3-5K)
├─ Timeline: 2-4 weeks
├─ Example: Get SOC 2 Type II certification
├─ Risk: Might be too slow; customer won't wait
└─ Best for: Non-blocking items

OPTION B: "We'll work with you on workaround"
├─ Cost: Customer effort (review + sign-off on alternative)
├─ Timeline: 1-2 weeks
├─ Example: Customer accepts audit trail as equivalent to SOC 2
├─ Risk: Requires customer to accept some risk
└─ Best for: Auditor preference (not hard requirement)

OPTION C: "Let's proceed with conditions"
├─ Cost: Risk acknowledgment document + customer signature
├─ Timeline: 1-2 days
├─ Example: Customer signs waiver; implements TAI with auditor exception
├─ Risk: Customer liability (unusual but possible)
└─ Best for: True blockers that can't be solved

Recommend: Combo approach
├─ Option B as primary path
├─ Option A for critical gap (if needed)
├─ Option C as fallback (last resort)
```

**Step 3: Customer Escalation (Same Day)**
```
CEO → Customer CEO call

Message: "We want to make sure we meet your compliance requirements"

Agenda:
├─ Clarify: "Is [issue] a hard blocker or auditor preference?"
├─ Propose: Option B or A (depending on customer preference)
├─ Timeline: "We can address this in [time]"
├─ Support: "We'll work with your auditor if needed"
├─ Commitment: "This won't delay your go-live"
└─ Next step: "Can we schedule call with your auditor?"

Call with auditor (if needed):
├─ CTO presents: How our audit trail works (cryptographic receipts)
├─ Compare: "Here's how we meet SOC 2 requirements"
├─ Document: Provide architecture + controls documentation
├─ Result: Auditor provides written approval/exception
└─ Timeline: 2-3 day turnaround possible
```

### Contingency Execution (Week 7-9)

**If Insurance Is Blocker:**
```
PLAYBOOK: Insurance Issue

Problem: Carrier won't insure autonomous systems

Action 1: Alternative carriers (24 hours)
├─ Current carrier: Standard cyber liability insurer
├─ Issue: "Autonomous systems" perceived as high-risk
├─ Solution: Find carrier that specializes in SaaS/AI
├─ Options:
│  ├─ Lloyd's of London (specialty carrier, higher cost)
│  ├─ XL Cyber (focuses on tech)
│  ├─ Corvus (AI/automation focus)
│  └─ Coalition (SaaS specialist)
├─ Timeline: Get quotes in 24 hours, decision in 3 days
└─ Cost: Likely $5-8K/year (vs. $3-5K standard)

Action 2: Self-insurance alternative (if no carrier available)
├─ Offer customer: "We carry the risk; customer has indemnification"
├─ Structure: Customer accepts risk; we reimburse if issue occurs
├─ Cost to us: $50K contingency reserve
├─ Document: Signed waiver + contract language
└─ Timeline: Implemented same day

Action 3: Reduce risk profile (if needed)
├─ Limit scope: "We handle governance; not payments/financial"
├─ Limit exposure: "Max liability per customer per year"
├─ Monitoring: "Continuous monitoring for issues"
└─ Documentation: "Full audit trail for any incident"

Output: Insurance obtained OR self-insurance plan OR risk mitigation
```

**If SOC 2 Type II Is Blocker:**
```
PLAYBOOK: SOC 2 Certification

Problem: Customer/auditor won't accept us without SOC 2 Type II

Reality check: SOC 2 Type II takes 12+ months (requires audit period)

Options:
├─ Option A: Start audit now; go live with Type I certification
│  ├─ Type I: "Controls are designed well" (we can get this in 2-4 weeks)
│  ├─ Type II: "Controls work over time" (requires 6-month audit period)
│  ├─ Customer reality: Type I + commitment to Type II acceptable?
│  └─ Path: Get Type I immediately; pursue Type II in background
├─ Option B: Customer auditor writes "exception letter"
│  ├─ Process: Customer's auditor reviews our controls + writes letter
│  ├─ Content: "Controls are acceptable per audit" (informal SOC 2)
│  ├─ Timeline: 1-2 weeks
│  └─ Acceptable: Often works for customer's auditors
├─ Option C: Defer to Phase 2 go-live (Month 2)
│  ├─ Path: Get full SOC 2 Type I in 4-6 weeks
│  ├─ Customer: Goes live on timeline with provisional certification
│  ├─ Extended trial: 30-day pilot (vs. full commitment)
│  └─ Risk: Customer might walk; offer discount to retain ($5K value)
└─ Recommend: Option A + B combo

Action 1: SOC 2 Type I (2-4 weeks)
├─ Hire SOC 2 auditor (Big 4 firm or specialist)
├─ Cost: $3-5K
├─ Work: Document controls + have auditor validate
├─ Timeline: Aggressive; doable in 4 weeks
└─ Output: SOC 2 Type I certificate (impressive but not Type II)

Action 2: Exception letter from customer's auditor (1-2 weeks)
├─ Schedule: Meeting between customer's auditor + our CTO
├─ Agenda: Review controls + audit trail + compliance measures
├─ Outcome: Auditor writes letter: "Controls acceptable; exception approved"
├─ Timeline: Fast turnaround (auditors want to unblock customer)
└─ Result: Customer gets auditor approval to proceed

Action 3: Customer communication
├─ CEO → Customer: "Here's our plan to address SOC 2"
├─ Path: Type I + auditor letter + Type II roadmap
├─ Timeline: Ready within [2-4 weeks]
├─ Commitment: "This will support your compliance needs"
└─ Offer: "Free audit support as we pursue Type II"

Output: SOC 2 pathway + auditor engagement
```

## Key Principles

### Remember These When Executing Contingencies

1. **Speed Over Perfection**
   - Activate contingency within 24-48 hours of trigger
   - Better to over-react early than to ignore and miss milestone

2. **Transparency with Stakeholders**
   - Notify board/investors immediately if contingency activated
   - Share status updates weekly
   - No surprises

3. **Customer First**
   - Communicate with customer before board
   - Solve their problem; second-order: solve ours
   - Transparency builds trust (even in crisis)

4. **Preserve Momentum**
   - Don't pause other work unless absolutely required
   - Contingency execution happens in parallel
   - Assign clear owner; CEO doesn't micromanage

5. **Document Everything**
   - Lessons learned from every contingency executed
   - Build playbook improvements based on execution
   - Share learnings with team (postmortem)

6. **Escalate Early**
   - If contingency owner unsure, escalate immediately
   - CEO + board call within 24 hours
   - Don't go dark; communicate status regularly

**Remember: Hope for the best, plan for the worst. These contingencies give you optionality when things don't go according to plan.**

**Execute with urgency. Act decisively. Keep the mission in focus: First revenue by Week 13. Everything else is secondary.**
