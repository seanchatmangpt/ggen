## Key Success Factors

### 1. Execution Velocity
**You need speed.** 2-3 calls/day Week 4. This builds momentum.

### 2. Data Quality
**Score honestly.** Don't inflate ICP scores. Use 75+ threshold rigorously.

### 3. Customization
**Every prospect is different.** Customize ROI, POC scope, positioning per prospect. Generic proposals fail.

### 4. Sponsor Engagement
**Get the champion involved.** Executive sponsorship = 5x higher close rate. Don't skip this step.

### 5. Timeline Discipline
**Week 3-4 is critical path.** First revenue depends on Week 3-4 pipeline quality. Treat it accordingly.

Week 3-4 execution quality determines first revenue timing. This package ensures quality execution at scale.

### This is NOT generic.
ROI calculations, value engineering, positioning, and templates are customized per prospect and per segment (SaaS vs CPaaS vs Fintech).

### This IS executable.
- Daily checklists (follow them in order)
- Scripts (use word-for-word or adapt)
- Templates (customize with prospect data)
- Metrics (track them weekly)
- Timeline (lock dates, move fast)
