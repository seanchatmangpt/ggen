# Post-Demo Follow-Up Sequence

**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Purpose:** Convert demo interest into signed POC proposals
**Cadence:** 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks

---

## Overview

Most demos don't result in immediate commitment. You need a structured follow-up sequence that:
1. Addresses unspoken concerns
2. Removes friction to decision
3. Creates urgency (POC spots fill up)
4. Delivers value (ROI calculator, case studies, answers)

**Success metric:** 70%+ of demoed prospects move to POC stage within 2 weeks

---

## 48-Hour Follow-Up Email

**Timing:** Send morning after demo (ideally 9am)

**Subject Line Examples:**
- "POC Proposal: [Customer Name] (Results attached)"
- "Your Inventory ROI: [High number]x return possible"
- "[Vertical] Success Story: How [Similar Company] did this"

**Email Template (Customize for each vertical):**

```
Subject: POC Proposal - [Hospital Name] Operations Dashboard

Hi [First Name],

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday to see TAI in action. Your team had excellent questions about EHR integration—I wanted to address those directly.

I've attached:
1. POC Proposal (30-day timeline, zero-cost pilot)
2. Customized ROI Calculator (pre-filled with YOUR hospital metrics)
3. Case Study: [Similar hospital] saw 78% discharge time reduction
4. Integration Checklist (what we need from your IT team)
5. FAQ: Common questions + answers

KEY NUMBERS FOR YOUR CFO:
- Cost: $0 (we cover POC setup)
- Expected Year 1 value: $2.2M (based on your discharge numbers)
- ROI: 92x return
- Implementation timeline: 30 days
- Downtime: Zero (runs alongside current system)

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
1. You review proposal with your team (1-2 hours)
2. We schedule 20-minute follow-up Friday (or Tuesday)
3. Any questions answered
4. If you like what you see, we kick off Monday of next week

I know Q1 is busy, so I want to make this easy. All the paperwork is ready to go—we just need your signature + EHR API access, and we're live.

Looking forward to making this happen,

[Your Name]
[Title]
[Phone]
[Email]

P.S. — Our POC cohort for Q1 fills up by mid-February. If you're serious about implementing TAI, let's lock in your spot this week.
```

**Attachments:**
- [ ] POC Proposal (PDF, customized)
- [ ] ROI Calculator (Google Sheets, pre-filled with their metrics)
- [ ] Case Study PDF (similar-sized customer)
- [ ] Integration Checklist (what you need from them)
- [ ] FAQ document (answers to common Q's)

**Tracking:** Add to CRM with "Email sent" timestamp + "Follow-up call scheduled for [day]"

## 48-Hour Phone Call (Optional, if they don't respond)

**Timing:** Call around 2pm (after they've had time to open email)

**Script (60-90 seconds):**

```
"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] from TAI. I know you're busy, but I wanted to check in quickly.

Did you get the POC proposal I sent this morning?

[LISTEN - they'll say yes or no]

Great. A couple quick things:

1. Your ROI calculator is pre-filled with the numbers you gave me yesterday.
   It shows $2.2M annual value for your hospital. Take a look and let me know
   if those assumptions are right.

2. The case study I attached is from [similar hospital]. They went live in 30 days
   and saw similar results to what we projected for you.

3. I want to make sure any questions get answered. Are you free for 20 minutes
   Friday or Tuesday to walk through the proposal?

The only constraint I want to flag: Our Q1 POC spots fill up in 2-3 weeks. If you
want to start in March, we should lock you in this week. Does that make sense?

What day works better for you—Friday or Tuesday?"

[SCHEDULE CALL]

"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite. Looking forward to moving this forward."
```

**Outcome tracking:**
- [ ] Call completed (yes/no)
- [ ] Questions identified (list them)
- [ ] Follow-up call scheduled (add to calendar)
- [ ] POC timeline communicated ("Start Week X")

## 1-Week Follow-Up Call

**Timing:** Exactly 7 days after demo

**Objective:** Address remaining questions, move toward decision

**Pre-Call Preparation:**
- [ ] Review notes from initial demo (capture their concern areas)
- [ ] Check their website/LinkedIn (any recent news? funding? hiring?)
- [ ] Prepare customized answers (don't generic Q&A, address THEIR concerns)

**Call Agenda (20 minutes):**

1. **Open (1 min):** "Thanks for reviewing the proposal. What questions came up?"

2. **Address Concerns (10-12 min):** Listen to their 2-3 main questions
   - If finance: "Is the ROI realistic?" → Show case studies + sensitivity analysis
   - If ops: "Is integration really 2 weeks?" → Walk through integration checklist
   - If tech: "Will this break anything?" → Security audit + integration approach

3. **Remove Friction (5 min):** Make it easy to say yes
   - "What's your biggest concern about getting this approved?"
   - "If we solve that, are you ready to move forward?"
   - "What would need to happen for you to sign POC agreement next week?"

4. **Commitment (2 min):** Get a clear next step
   - "So if I send over the POC agreement Tuesday, can you sign by Wednesday?"
   - "Should I send it to you, or does it go to your CFO first?"

**Script for Common Objections:**

**If: "I need to talk to my team first"**
```
"Totally fair. Who on your team needs to be involved? The CFO? Your CTO?

Let me ask—if they approved this, would you be ready to sign the POC agreement?

[LISTEN]

OK, here's what I suggest: Let me send you a CFO summary and a tech summary.
You forward those to your team. In a few days, I can jump on a call with all of you
if there are questions. Does that work?
```

**If: "We need to finish our current project first"**
```
"I totally get that. When does [current project] wrap up?

[LISTEN]

OK, so you'd be ready to start POC in [Month]? That actually works well for us—
Q2 is less busy than Q1. Here's what I suggest: Let me add you to our Q2 cohort
(which fills up too). Even if you're not 100% ready yet, I can keep you updated
with product news and customer success stories. By the time you're ready, you'll
already understand the value. Sound good?
```

**If: "The pricing seems high"**
```
"I hear you. Let me ask: Based on the ROI we calculated, what would feel like
a fair price?

[LISTEN]

Here's what I'm hearing: The value is clear, but the price is an obstacle.
Here's what we can do: In the POC, you prove the value yourself using your
actual data. If you hit 50% of the projected ROI, does the price feel reasonable?

[LISTEN]

OK, so if you can prove $1.1M value in 30 days, you'd be ready to move forward?

[If yes] Then let's just lock in the POC, measure the value, and make the
decision based on your actual results. Fair?
```

**Closing the Call:**
- If YES to moving forward: "Excellent. I'll send the POC agreement tomorrow. Can you sign by Wednesday?"
- If MAYBE: "What would move this to a yes? Is it more information? Or do we need to wait?"
- If NO: "I totally respect that. Let's stay in touch. I'll check back in [month] to see if timing is better."

   - Sign + return to me

   - 30 min to explain process
   - Discuss integration timeline
   - Answer any final questions

4. POC starts the following Monday
   - Your team runs TAI in parallel with current system

```

## 2-Week Follow-Up Email

**Timing:** Exactly 14 days after original demo

**Objective:** Create urgency, move fence-sitters to decision

**Subject Line Examples:**
- "Q1 POC spots closing (3 left for your vertical)"
- "Your ROI calculation: $2.2M opportunity closing soon"
- "[Vertical] market update: Competitors moving fast"

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Urgent: Q1 POC Spots Filling (Last chance for March start)

Hi [Name],

Quick update: Your POC spot is filling fast. Here's where we are:

Q1 POC COHORT STATUS:
├── Healthcare: 2 spots left (started with 4)
├── Finance: 1 spot left
├── E-Commerce: 2 spots left

[Your Company] was top of my list for March because:
- Your problem is textbook (inventory misallocation)
- Your ROI is clear ($2.2M value potential)
- Your team is ready (good cultural fit)

TIMING DECISION NEEDED:
If you want to start POC in March, I need your signed agreement by Friday.

If you wait until April, no problem—but:
- Spring peak season means your team is busier
- Seasonal inventory surge (harder to measure impact)
- Competitors launching similar solutions Q2 (worth knowing about)

Here's my recommendation:
1. Spend 1 hour Friday reviewing the POC proposal
2. Send me any final questions
3. Sign + return (5 minutes)
4. Kick off Monday with your team
5. Measure for 30 days
6. Decide based on actual results (not projections)

Risk is zero. Value is measurable. Timeline is clear.

Ready to move forward?

[Your Name]

P.S. — I know January/February is crazy. If you're genuinely not ready until Q2,
that's fine—I'll put you on our Q2 list. But let me know so I can free up your
March spot for another prospect. Just reply with "Q2 works better" and I'll take
you off the urgent list.
```

## Key Principles for Follow-Up

### Do This:
✅ Customize every email (use their name, their metrics, their industry)
✅ Provide value (case studies, ROI calculator, FAQ answers)
✅ Remove friction (make it easy to say yes)
✅ Create urgency (POC spots fill up, seasonal timing)
✅ Respect their timeline (if not ready now, stay in touch)

### Don't Do This:
❌ Generic boilerplate ("Hi [Customer]...")
❌ Too many emails (more than 1 every 3-4 days is spam)
❌ Demand immediate decision (let them think)
❌ Disappear after "no" (stay in touch, revisit Q2)
❌ Oversell (underpromise, overdeliver)
