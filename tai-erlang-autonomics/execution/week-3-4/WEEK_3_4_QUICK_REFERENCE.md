## ICP Scoring Quick Lookup (1-10 Scale)

**Manual Effort (1-10):**
- 10 = 3-5+ FTE/month, heavy manual work
- 7 = 1-2 FTE/month, mixed manual
- 4 = <10 hrs/month, mostly automated
- 1 = Zero manual effort

**Compliance (1-10):**
- 10 = SOC2/HIPAA/regulated + entitlements are audited
- 7 = Compliance required but not on entitlements yet
- 4 = Compliance-lite (nice-to-have)
- 1 = No compliance requirements

**Performance/Scale (1-10):**
- 10 = Hitting 10K+ RPS, latency issues, scale problems
- 7 = 1K-10K RPS, occasional latency issues
- 4 = <1K RPS, no performance issues yet
- 1 = No scale issues

**Budget (1-10):**
- 10 = Pre-approved $200K+ budget
- 7 = Budget available but needs approval
- 4 = Budget request possible but slower
- 1 = No budget for 2026

**Timeline (1-10):**
- 10 = Q1 2026 decision needed (<4 weeks)
- 7 = Q1-Q2 2026 (4-8 weeks)
- 4 = Q2-Q3 (2+ months)
- 1 = 2027 budget cycle

**Tech Fit (1-10):**

- 7 = GCP present + some multi-cloud
- 4 = AWS-only or other cloud
- 1 = On-prem only, no cloud

- 10 = $500K+ annual savings or revenue at risk
- 7 = $200K-500K impact

## Email Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Cold Outreach

```
Subject: SKU management overhead at [Company]?

Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Company]'s product and noticed you manage multiple
pricing tiers across regions. That complexity usually means teams spend
40-50 hours/month on manual SKU provisioning—at least that's what peers
like [similar company] are telling us.

We built TAI specifically to cut that work by 80% while adding compliance
audit trails.

Worth a quick 15-min call to see if this resonates?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Phone]

P.S. No pressure if this isn't on your radar today.
```

### Warm Intro Request

```
Subject: Intro to [VP Product]?

Hi [Mutual Connection],

I hope you're well. I'm reaching out because I'm launching TAI, a product
that automates SKU management and entitlement governance—the stuff that
usually takes 3-5 FTE per month of work.

I know [VP Product] at [Company], and I think they might be a good fit given
[their business context]. Would you be comfortable introducing us?

Quick background: [1-line your credential]
We're targeting companies like [Intercom/Twilio/similar] with this pain.

Let me know if it makes sense!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Post-Call Thank You

```
Subject: Great conversation today!

Hi [First Name],

Really appreciated our chat about [Company]'s entitlement scaling challenge.
A few things that stood out:

1. You're managing [specific detail they mentioned]
2. [Main pain point they shared]
3. [Secondary pain point]

I've attached a quick overview of how TAI would tackle #[main pain], plus a
ROI calc based on what you shared (rough estimate).

If this resonates, I'd love to get our technical team involved next week for
a 30-min deep dive. If not, no pressure—I'll stay on your radar anyway.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up (No Response)

```
Subject: Following up on SKU management

Hi [First Name],

Sent something a few days back about TAI—no worries if it got buried.

Quick version: We help companies cut SKU management overhead by 80% while
passing compliance audits more easily.

Worth 15 min to chat? Either way, I'll stay on your radar.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## ROI Calculation Quick Math

**On the fly during call (mental math):**

**Their manual effort:**
- "We spend 50 hours/month on SKU work"
- @$125/hour (fully-loaded engineer cost)
- = $6,250/month = **$75K/year**

**TAI savings:**
- Reduce by 80% = **$60K/year saved**
- + Compliance audit savings (rough: 50% of $30K audit = $15K)
- **Total Year 1 savings: ~$75K**

**TAI investment:**
- Year 1: $150K platform + services
- Payback: ~8 months

**Your pitch:**
> "So you're running about $75K in wasted effort per year. TAI would reduce that by $60K+ while eliminating auditor findings. Your investment is $150K but you hit payback in 8 months. From there, it's pure efficiency gain + compliance peace of mind."

---

## Top 3 Objection Responses

### Objection 1: "We're happy with our current system"

**Response:**
> "That's fair. Most companies are happy until they scale or need compliance. Quick question: As you add new tiers or regions, how long does it take to deploy? For most, it's 1-3 weeks. TAI does it in 2 hours. Even if you're happy now, that speed advantage alone might be worth exploring."

---

### Objection 2: "We can build this ourselves"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, you could. Most large companies have. Here's what we're seeing: it typically takes 6-12 engineer-months to build, then ongoing ops burden. TAI is ready to go in 30 days, fully managed. Your engineers are better spent on product than infrastructure. But if you're thinking strategic build, that's fine—I'd just ask: is that the best use of their time right now?"

---

### Objection 3: "We don't have budget for this"

**Response:**
> "Totally understand. Budget is always tight. Quick question though: if we could show you how to save $60K+ in labor costs this year, would that change the conversation? That's what we typically see. Sometimes it's a budget reallocation instead of new money."

---

## Success Signals (During Call)

✓ **Green Flags (Keep Calling):**
- "We've been struggling with this for 2+ years"
- "Our auditors flagged this as a gap"
- "We're losing deals because of scaling limitations"
- "How soon could you start?" (urgency!)
- "Our VP of Product has been asking for this"
- "Budget is already approved"

✗ **Red Flags (Consider Passing):**
- "We're never going to move to cloud" (wrong segment)
- "Our system is perfect, no changes needed" (satisfied, no urgency)
- "Budget is gone for 2026" (timing wrong)
- "We'd need 6+ months for evaluation" (too slow)
- "We rejected similar solutions before" (understand why first)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Pitch product before understanding pain (ask first, tell second)
- Take 60+ minute calls (45 min max)
- Send generic follow-ups (personalize every email)
- Use "contact" mode in CRM (actually talk to people)
- Forget to capture ICP score immediately post-call
- Send POC proposal without warm-up call (you'll get rejected)
- Set calendar invites without human conversation first

✓ **Do:**
- Listen 70%, talk 30% (quiet voice wins deals)
- Take detailed notes during every call (shows respect)
- Send thank you + custom ROI within 1 hour (strike while hot)
- Follow up every prospect 2-3 times (most say yes on 3rd touch)
- Pre-qualify before sending proposal (saves time)
- Get executive sponsor name + approval before POC (top-down matters)

---

## Week 3-4 Prayer (For Motivation)

> "In 2 weeks, I will have 20 meaningful conversations with people who have real problems TAI solves. I will listen more than I talk. I will send custom follow-ups within the hour. I will score prospects fairly (no inflating scores). I will send 3-5 quality POC proposals, not 10 generic ones. I will qualify prospects ruthlessly (only 75+ scores advance to POC). I will celebrate small wins (calls completed, prospects engaged). I will trust the process: discovery → qualification → POC → revenue. I will move fast but not break things. Let's go."
