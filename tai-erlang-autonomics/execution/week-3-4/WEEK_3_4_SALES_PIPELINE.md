- [ ] Research tech stack (G2, StackShare, job postings)
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 pain point hypotheses
- [ ] Identify mutual connections for credibility

### Opening (2 min)

> "Thanks for taking time. I appreciate it. At TAI, we work with [similar companies like Intercom/Stripe-type platforms] solving one specific problem: autonomous SKU management and entitlement governance. I know you're busy, so I'm gonna ask some targeted questions about your current situation and just listen. Fair?"

### Section 1: Current State (10 min)

**Q1-6:** Operational baseline + systems landscape
- How many people on your team managing SKUs/entitlements each week?
- What does your current entitlement/quota system look like?
- How do you currently track changes to SKU rules?
- Have you had incidents with incorrect entitlements?
- What's your current tech stack?
- Do you use GCP today?

*Listen for: Manual effort (1-5+ FTE/month), scaling challenges, no audit trail*

### Section 2: Pain Points (10 min)

**Q7-12:** Compliance, performance, agility
- Do you have compliance requirements?
- When auditors ask about entitlements, what's your answer?
- How many concurrent entitlement checks do you support?
- Have you hit performance issues?
- How long to launch a new pricing tier or change a quota?
- Have you delayed product launches due to entitlement complexity?

*Listen for: Compliance gaps, latency bottlenecks, slow time-to-market*

### Section 3: Business Impact (10 min)

**Q13-16:** Quantifying cost + budget authority
- How much time (hours/month) do you spend on SKU/entitlement management?
- How much revenue is at risk if entitlements fail?
- Who controls budget for tools like this?
- What's your typical procurement timeline?

*Listen for: $500K+ annual wasted effort + compliance risk, clear budget process*

### Section 4: Organizational Readiness (8 min)

**Q17-20:** Integration readiness + sponsorship
- Do you have in-house engineering or need professional services?
- Have you evaluated other autonomic governance solutions?
- Who's your biggest champion for solving this?
- If we reduced manual effort 50% + gave audit trail, what would you do with freed time?

*Listen for: Strong VP-level sponsor, clear vision for freed-up capacity*

### Closing (2 min)

> "Based on this conversation, it sounds like [summarize pain points: e.g., 'you've got 3 FTE/month wasted on manual SKU work, compliance auditors flagged your entitlement audit trail as a gap, and you want to move faster on pricing changes']. We've seen similar challenges at [peer company]. Would it make sense to spend 30 minutes next week with our technical team to see if we could actually help? If not, no pressure—I'll send you a summary of what we discussed anyway. How does that sound?"

### ROI Narrative (Sample Wording)

> "Based on what you shared, your current manual SKU management is running ~40 hours/month across 3 engineers. That's $60K/year in wasted effort plus $50K/year in compliance audit overhead. TAI would reduce both by 70%, freeing up $77K/year in labor while eliminating your auditors' main finding about entitlement audit trails. Your investment in TAI would be $150K/year, but with the labor saved plus compliance benefits, you'd hit break-even in 7 months and see $100K+ net benefit by Year 2. Most importantly, you'd go from 2-week cycles on new pricing tiers to 2 hours. Is this value formula roughly what you were thinking?"

## Value Engineering Playbook

### For Enterprise SaaS Prospects

**Main Value Driver:** Labor efficiency + compliance audit time savings
- Manual SKU effort: 3-5 FTE/month
- Compliance audit finding: Entitlement audit trail gap
- ROI Target: 2-4x in Year 1
- Contract Value: $150K-$300K/year

**ROI Narrative:**
> "You're running [X] manual hours/month on entitlements, and your auditors flagged the lack of cryptographic audit trails. We could eliminate both—TAI provides a cryptographically verified receipt ledger and reduces manual work by 80%. That's [Y] FTE freed up at [Z] cost, plus $50K/year in audit overhead avoided. Your investment: $150K/year. Break-even: Month 7."

---

### For CPaaS/Cloud Platform Prospects

**Main Value Driver:** Revenue protection + customer satisfaction
- Revenue leakage: $500K-$5M/year from entitlement bugs
- Customer churn: 2-5% of high-MRR customers from quota issues
- Performance SLA: <50ms latency vs. current 500ms+ DB triggers
- ROI Target: 5-10x in Year 1
- Contract Value: $300K-$750K/year

**ROI Narrative:**
> "Each entitlement bug costs you $100K+ in revenue leakage and customer escalations. You've had [X] incidents in the past year, so that's $[Y] at-risk annually. Plus, quota enforcement latency is hurting your SLA commitments. TAI handles multi-tenant entitlements at <50ms, eliminating the latency issue and 80% of bugs through autonomic governance. ROI: Recover even $500K of revenue risk + avoid 1-2 incidents, your investment is paid for immediately."

---

### For Fintech/Regulated Prospects

**Main Value Driver:** Compliance + audit readiness + speed-to-market
- Annual audit cost: $100K-$500K
- Fee logic change cycle: 2-4 weeks (vs. 2 hours with TAI)
- Regulatory risk: Non-compliance findings = deal blockers
- ROI Target: 1-5x in Year 1
- Contract Value: $150K-$400K/year

**ROI Narrative:**
> "Your auditors spend $[X] on entitlement logic reviews. We provide cryptographically verified receipts for every entitlement change, turning what's now a 3-month audit into a 1-month audit. That's $[Y] savings right there. Plus, you could change fee structures in hours instead of weeks—launch new products 10x faster. ROI: Break-even on audit savings alone, plus you accelerate revenue growth."

## Competitive Displacement Playbook

### Versus Manual + Spreadsheets (40% of prospects likely here)

**Their Status Quo:** Excel files + Slack notifications + manual rule enforcement

**Our Positioning:**
> "Manual processes are how you scale to a certain point, but once you hit 100+ customers or 10+ SKUs, the error rate spikes and audit compliance becomes impossible. TAI automates the 80% of rule enforcement that doesn't need human judgment, leaving your team for strategy and edge cases."

**Conversation Starter:**
> "What's your biggest pain point with the current spreadsheet approach? Let me guess: [1) versioning chaos, 2) audit trail gaps, 3) customer escalations from errors, 4) scaling to new regions]?"

---

### Versus Database Triggers (30% of prospects likely here)

**Their Status Quo:** Application logic in stored procedures or DB triggers

**Our Positioning:**
> "DB-based enforcement is flexible but it doesn't scale. You get latency issues at >1,000 RPS, no audit trail for compliance, and changes require re-deploying the entire application. TAI is built for scale from the ground up with <50ms latency and a cryptographic receipt ledger."

**Conversation Starter:**
> "Have you hit latency issues with your current DB-trigger approach? Most companies do by the time they hit [X region scale]. TAI handles 10x your current throughput at 1/10th the latency."

---

### Versus Legacy Systems (Oracle, SAP - 20% of prospects, usually enterprise)

**Their Status Quo:** $1M+ system, 6-month implementation, rigid pricing rules

**Our Positioning:**
> "Legacy systems are deep but slow. New pricing structure takes 3-6 months to implement and costs $100K+ in services. TAI deploys in 3 weeks, pricing changes in 2 hours, and you could add TAI alongside your legacy system (not rip-and-replace)."

**Conversation Starter:**
> "I know you have [Legacy system] running entitlements today. Given the pace of your business now, are you able to launch new pricing when you want? Or do you have to wait for [Legacy system] team?"

---

### Versus Open-Source Solutions (Cassandra-based - 10% of prospects, tech-savvy)

**Their Status Quo:** Open-source option like OpenStack-based entitlement engine

**Our Positioning:**
> "Open-source gives you flexibility but shifts operational burden to your team. TAI is SaaS, so you don't run the infrastructure, and you get enterprise support. Plus, we handle the multi-tenant isolation and compliance pieces that most open-source projects don't tackle."

**Conversation Starter:**
> "Are you considering building/maintaining your own solution? What's your team's appetite for operational overhead vs. outsourcing this to a specialist?"

## Cold Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: Pain-First Cold Email

**Subject:** SKU management overhead at [Company]?

```
Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Company]'s product and it seems like you manage multiple pricing tiers across regions. That complexity typically means your team spends 40-50 hours/month on manual SKU provisioning—at least that's what we're seeing with peers like [Intercom/Stripe/similar].

We built TAI specifically to cut that work by 80% while adding a cryptographic audit trail for compliance.

Worth a quick 15-min call to see if this is even on your radar?

Best,
[Your Name]
TAI Erlang Autonomics
https://[company-website]

P.S. No pressure—if this doesn't resonate, I'd still love to stay connected.
```

---

### Template 2: Warm Intro Request Email

**Subject:** Intro to [VP Product]?

```
Hi [Mutual Connection],

I hope you're well. I'm reaching out because I'm launching TAI, a product that automates SKU management and entitlement governance (the stuff that usually takes 3-5 FTE worth of work per month).

I know [VP Product] at [Company], and I think they might be a good fit given your product's complexity around multi-tier pricing. Would you be comfortable introducing us?

Quick background: [1-line personal credential]. We're targeting companies like [Intercom/Twilio/similar] that have this pain.

Let me know if it makes sense!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Template 3: Follow-Up Email (Post-No-Response)

**Subject:** Following up on SKU management

```
Hi [First Name],

I sent something a few days back about TAI—no worries if you didn't see it amid everything else.

I'll be brief: We help companies cut SKU management overhead by 80% while passing compliance audits more easily. If that's not a pain point today, no problem. But if it is, I'd love 15 minutes to talk.

Either way, I'll stay on your radar.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Template 4: Post-Call Follow-Up Email

**Subject:** Great conversation today!

```
Hi [First Name],

Really appreciated our chat about [Company]'s entitlement scaling challenge. A few things stood out:

1. You're managing [X SKUs] across [Y regions] with mostly manual processes
2. Compliance audits take [3-6 months] and flag your entitlement audit trail as a gap
3. New pricing tiers take [2-4 weeks] to launch

I've attached a 1-page overview of how TAI would tackle 1-2 of these, plus a quick ROI calc showing what 80% automation could mean for your team.

If it resonates, I'd love to get our technical team involved next week for a 30-min deep dive. No pressure—let me know what makes sense for you.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
P.S. [Optional: Ask a clarifying follow-up question from the call]
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Can't reach 20 discovery calls in 2 weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Focus first week on warm intros only (higher connection rate: 40-50% vs 5-10% cold)
- Accept calls from lower-ICP prospects to build rhythm (practice pitching)
- Schedule back-to-back calls (3-4 calls/day instead of 1-2)
- **Contingency:** Extend to 15 calls by end of Week 4 (lower but acceptable)

---

### Risk 2: ICP Score inflation (prospects scoring 75+ but not actually fit)

**Mitigation:**
- Use standardized scorecard (don't subjectively inflate)
- Have CTO review scoring (technical perspective)
- Verify pain points with second conversation before sending POC proposal
- **Contingency:** Require 2 positive data points from 8 dimensions (not just high average)

---

### Risk 3: No response from cold outreach

**Mitigation:**
- Follow the 3-touch sequence: Day 1 LinkedIn → Day 3 Email → Day 7 Follow-up Email
- Segment cold outreach (send to 35 prospects over 4 days, not all at once)
- A/B test subject lines (pain-first vs. product-first)
- Use referral angle ("Your CTO recommended I talk to you")
- **Contingency:** Pivot to warm intros + investor network (higher conversion, slower but safer)

---

### Risk 4: Prospects have budget but timeline is 2026 or later

**Mitigation:**
- Identify prospects with Q1 budget already allocated (ask directly)
- Tier prospects by timeline: Now (2-4 weeks) vs. Soon (6-8 weeks) vs. Later (3+ months)
- Focus POC proposals on "Now" segment only
- Nurture "Later" segment for future cycles
- **Contingency:** Extend decision timeline to Q2 if "Now" segment is <2 prospects

---

### Risk 5: CRM tool selection delays outreach

**Mitigation:**
- Use Google Sheets for Week 1 outreach tracking (zero setup time)
- Upgrade to Pipedrive by Wednesday Week 1 for call tracking
- Simple structure: Company | Contact | Email | Status | Call Date | Notes
- **Contingency:** Stick with Google Sheets throughout Week 3-4 if Pipedrive integration issues arise
