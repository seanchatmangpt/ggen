## Recommendations for Board / Investors

### 1. Week 3-4 Execution is Critical Path to First Revenue

**Why:** Discovery conversations determine pipeline quality. If we hit 20 calls and qualify 5-10 prospects at ICP 75+, we're on track for Q2 revenue. If we fall short, we push to Q3.

**Action:** Weekly exec syncs during Week 3-4 to identify and clear any blockers immediately.

---

### 2. POC Execution Speed Matters More Than POC Perfection

**Why:** 30-day POCs are short. We need quick wins to build momentum and case studies.

**Action:** Prioritize 3 POCs (1 per segment: SaaS / CPaaS / Fintech) for Week 5 launch. Over-invest in customer success.

---

### 3. Build Sales Muscle Early (Hire VP Sales or Fractional)

**Why:** Current burn is happening Week 3-4 with no revenue. We need proven sales leadership.

**Action:** Hire VP Sales by Week 5 (or secure fractional sales advisor). This person leads POC → Contract → Expansion.

---

### 4. Set Realistic Timeline Expectations

**Why:** Discovery + POC + Contract takes 60-90 days minimum. First revenue likely Week 7-10 (not earlier).

**Action:** Confirm board/investor expectations. Set runway for 4 months before revenue. Extend if needed.

---

### 5. Leverage First Customers as References

**Why:** Tier 2 growth (Customers 4-10) depends on Tier 1 references.

**Action:** Lock down reference agreements with first 3 customers. Plan case study + joint PR by Month 3.

---

## Success Criteria (Week 3-4 Complete)

**MUST ACHIEVE:**
- ✓ 20 discovery calls completed (minimum 15 acceptable)
- ✓ 5-10 qualified prospects (ICP 75+)
- ✓ 3-5 POC proposals sent by Friday EOD Week 4
- ✓ $150K-$300K qualified pipeline value
- ✓ 3-5 executive sponsors engaged
- ✓ All prospects ICP-scored and tiered
- ✓ CRM clean + ready for Week 5

**NICE-TO-HAVE:**
- ✓ 2-3 POCs signed (would accelerate timeline)
- ✓ 15-20 additional prospects (for expansion pipeline)
- ✓ Partnership opportunities identified (channel plays)
- ✓ Case study/PR opportunity with early champion
