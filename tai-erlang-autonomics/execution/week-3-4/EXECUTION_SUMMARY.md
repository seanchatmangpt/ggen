## Key Success Factors

### 1. Demo Environment Reliability
- Staging environment must not crash during demo
- Failover: Have screen recording + phone backup ready
- Test everything day before demo

### 2. Realistic Customer Scenarios
- Use actual customer numbers (don't invent metrics)
- Healthcare: 300-bed hospital is realistic scale
- Finance: $500M AUM is realistic hedge fund size
- E-Commerce: $20M GMV is realistic DTC brand size

### 3. Transparent ROI Math
- Show the formula (not just final number)
- Provide sensitivity analysis (downside/base/upside)
- Be conservative (underpromise, overdeliver)
- Use their actual metrics (pre-filled calculator)

### 4. Sales Confidence
- Sales team must rehearse scripts multiple times
- Demo scripts are word-for-word (don't ad lib)
- FAQ provides confident answers to 50+ questions
- Objection responses are tested + proven

### 5. Follow-Up Automation
- 48-hour email sent automatically (template ready)
- 1-week call scheduled in calendar before demo
- 2-week final push email queued
- Decision tree guides next steps

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Demo Environment Breaks
- Mitigation: Screen recording of demo as backup
- Mitigation: Phone number ready for Zoom screen share
- Mitigation: Restart environment + reload data (10 min outage acceptable)

### Risk: Prospect Doesn't Understand ROI
- Mitigation: Pre-filled ROI calculator (customized to their metrics)
- Mitigation: Transparent math (show formula)
- Mitigation: Sensitivity analysis (what if we're only half right?)

### Risk: Sales Team Not Prepared
- Mitigation: Scripts provided (word-for-word)
- Mitigation: FAQ with 50+ answers
- Mitigation: Objection handling scripts
- Mitigation: Rehearsal requirement (run demo 2x before executing)

### Risk: Low POC Conversion
- Mitigation: Post-demo sequence (48hr, 1-week, 2-week follow-ups)
- Mitigation: Urgency messaging ("Q1 spots filling up")
- Mitigation: Soft close technique (don't demand immediate yes)
