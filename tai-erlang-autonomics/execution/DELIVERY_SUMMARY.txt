FAQ - COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can I modify this plan?
A: YES. This is a template. Adapt to your situation but maintain the core
   structure: Legal → Product → Sales → Customer → Scale

Q: What if I don't hit Week 7 revenue?
A: Common to extend to Week 8-10. NOT a failure. Adjust forecast. Key is
   systematic execution (not panicking).

Q: Should I follow 100% as written?
A: 90% adherence is good. 100% is rare. Aim for:
   - 100% on legal (critical)
   - 90% on product (iteration OK)
   - 85% on sales (market dependent)
   - 100% on customer success

Q: What if I need to fundraise?
A: Avoid during these 90 days. Focus on execution. Use these 90 days to
   prove concept. Series A conversations start Week 12-16.

Q: How often should I revisit this plan?
A: Weekly Friday review (adjust next week). Monthly with board.
   Major replanning if: revenue delayed >2 weeks, customer churn,
   key hire fails, or major market change.
