- Customer legal review extends past Wednesday → Risk of slip to Week 7
- Customer requests 5+ contract modifications → May indicate deeper concerns
- Customer won't commit to pricing → May not be serious buyer
- Customer legal demands unlimited liability → Red flag, likely walk-away
- Deposit not received by Friday → Can't start Week 7 (reschedule kickoff)
