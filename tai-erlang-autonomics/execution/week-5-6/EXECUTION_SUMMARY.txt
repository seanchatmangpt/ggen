================================================================================
RISK MITIGATION
================================================================================

RISK 1: POC candidate not qualified enough
  → Use ICP scoring matrix (must score 75+)
  → Validate during initial discovery call
  → Escalate to CEO if uncertain

RISK 2: Pricing negotiation extends past Wednesday
  → Prepare ROI model before call (quantify value)
  → Use three-tier pricing framework (gives options)
  → Have walk-away price locked (floor price not negotiable below X)

RISK 3: Legal review extends past Wednesday
  → Respond to customer feedback within 24 hours
  → Proactively loop in customer's counsel (show respect)
  → Prepare interim controls if SOC 2 not yet certified

RISK 4: Deposit not received by Friday
  → Invoice sent immediately upon signature (same day)
  → Follow up by phone Day 3 (Wednesday) if no response
  → Confirm payment method & processing time (ACH vs. wire vs. credit card)

RISK 5: Customer legal demands unreasonable terms
  → Red flags: Unlimited liability cap, exclusive territory, IP assignment demands
  → Walk away threshold: If customer demands >50% discount or custom features worth >$20K
  → Escalate to CEO for final decision authority

================================================================================
