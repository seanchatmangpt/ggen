Severity Thresholds:
<$10K impact        → Risk owner decides + inform CEO (same day)
$10K-$50K impact    → Risk owner + CEO decide + inform board (same day)

>1 week slip        → Automatic board notification (same day)
Production incident → CTO decides; CEO informs board (within 2 hours)
Team departure      → CEO decides; board notification (same day)

Chain of Command:
Risk Owner (VP/Exec) → CEO → Lead Investor → Full Board

Notification Method:
Severity: Email (15 min) + Phone call (4 hours) + Board meeting (24 hours)

How We Know This System Is Working:

✅ Detection: Risks detected within 24h of warning signal (vs. 1 week before)
✅ Escalation: RED risks escalated to board same day (not delayed)
✅ Execution: Contingencies activated within 24-48 hours (when needed)
✅ Learning: Each contingency results in playbook improvement
✅ Prevention: Risks prevented/mitigated before escalation (best case)
✅ Team Confidence: Team feels prepared + supported (survey annually)
