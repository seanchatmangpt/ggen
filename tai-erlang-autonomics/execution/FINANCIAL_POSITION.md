## CASH FLOW SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### Best Case Scenario (Revenue Accelerated)

```
IF FIRST REVENUE COMES WEEK 5 (instead of Week 7):
├─ Customer #1 contract: Week 5 (Feb 28)
├─ Go-live: Week 8 (Mar 17)
├─ Revenue impact: +$10K (one month earlier)
├─ Cash position improvement: +$10K
└─ New runway: 23+ weeks (vs 21+ weeks)
└─ Status: No change to Series A timeline
```

### Worst Case Scenario (Revenue Delayed)

```
IF FIRST REVENUE DELAYED TO WEEK 10 (2-week slip):
├─ Customer #1 contract: Week 10 (Mar 24)
├─ Go-live: Week 13 (Apr 14)
├─ Revenue impact: -$20K (delayed by 1 month)
├─ Cash position impact: -$20K burn extension
└─ New runway: 19+ weeks (vs 21+ weeks)
└─ Status: Still safe, Series A conversations start
```

### Critical Scenario (Revenue Delayed 8+ Weeks)

```
IF REVENUE DELAYED TO WEEK 12 (5+ week slip):
├─ Total additional burn: ~$50K-100K (5+ weeks × $20K)
├─ New cash position: $230-280K (vs $332K baseline)
├─ New runway: 12-16 weeks (RED FLAG)
├─ Mitigation:
│  ├─ Reduce team to 3 FTE (-$30K/week in salaries)
│  ├─ Focus 100% on sales (no new product features)
│  ├─ Pause non-essential spending (-$10K/week)
│  └─ Series A discussions accelerate to Day 50 (not Day 84)
└─ Status: URGENT - Board meeting + fundraising plan
```

```

### Red Flags (Trigger Financial Review)

🔴 **Critical:** If ANY of these occur, emergency financial review

1. **Weekly spend > $25K** (2x plan)
2. **Monthly burn > 3% of cash** ($15K+)
3. **Unplanned major expense** (> $20K)
4. **Revenue delay beyond 2 weeks** (vs Week 7 target)
5. **Cash position < $250K** (50% depletion)
6. **Runway < 16 weeks** (4-month warning)
