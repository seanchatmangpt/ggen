## SECTION 13: STRATEGIC PIVOTS (IF NEEDED)

### Scenario A: Revenue Misses Target (Below $125K by Month 12)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Double Down on First Vertical**

   - Ignore others temporarily
   - Build complete solution for vertical

2. **Lower ACV, Higher Volume**
   - Introduce SMB product tier ($15-20K ACV)
   - Sacrifices margin for volume
   - Requires different sales motion

3. **Shift to Managed Services**
   - Offer implementation as service (higher margin)
   - Becomes consulting + software hybrid
   - Slower scaling, more profitable

**Mitigation:** Monthly revenue tracking, early warning system, advisor guidance

3. **Strategic Investment**
   - Customer advances (pre-payment for implementation)
   - Corporate partner investment
   - Slower cash, but validates product

**Mitigation:** Begin conversations in Month 4, not Month 9

---

### Scenario C: Product Scaling Issues

**Trigger:** If uptime <99% or response time >500ms p95

**Pivot Options:**
