```
Hour 0-2:   Intelligence: What are they offering?

## DECISION TREES (When to Act)

### "Should I Activate a Contingency?"
```
FLOW:

3. Tell CEO immediately? (YES → Always)
4. Need board approval? (YES if >$50K impact)
5. Execute within 24 hours? (YES)

If uncertain, ACTIVATE and course-correct.
Better to over-react than under-react.
```

```
TRIGGER → CONTINGENCY:
├─ Sales/Pipeline issue → Contingency 1, 2, 8
