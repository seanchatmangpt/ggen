## FAQ About This Plan

**Q: Can I modify this plan?**
A: YES. This is a template. Adapt to your specific situation:
- Market timeline (faster/slower sales cycle?)
- Team size (different hiring plan?)
- Product scope (fewer/more MVP features?)

But maintain the core structure: Legal → Product → Sales → Customer → Scale

**Q: What if I don't hit the Week 7 revenue?**
A: Common scenarios are Week 8-10. NOT a failure. Adjust forecast. Key is systematic execution (not panicking).

**Q: Should I do this plan 100% as written?**
A: 90% adherence is good. 100% is rare (things always change). Aim for:
- 100% on legal (critical path)
- 90% on product (iteration OK)
- 85% on sales (market dependent)
- 100% on customer success (make them happy!)

**Q: How often should I revisit this plan?**
A: Weekly on Friday during team review. Monthly with board. Major replanning if:
- Revenue delayed >2 weeks
- Customer churn occurs
- Key hire fails
- Major market change

**Q: What if I need to fundraise during these 90 days?**
A: Avoid if possible. Focus on execution. Use these 90 days to prove concept. Series A conversations start Week 12-16 (after first revenue).
