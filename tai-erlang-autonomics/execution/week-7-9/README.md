## RISK MITIGATION SUMMARY

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Customer doesn't provide baseline data | Use estimation + customer sign-off, validate in first month |
| Technical delays | Pre-planning, modular integration, manual workarounds |
| Metrics don't match | Daily reconciliation, formula validation, customer involvement |
| Go-live issues | Pre-flight checks, rollback plan, staging environment test |
| Value doesn't materialize | Weekly reviews, process optimization, scope adjustment |
