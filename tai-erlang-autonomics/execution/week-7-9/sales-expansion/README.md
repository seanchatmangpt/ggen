## SUCCESS STORIES & PROOF POINTS

### Customer #1 (Being Implemented Week 7-9)
- **Vertical**: TBD
- **Size**: TBD
- **Pain Point**: TBD
- **Baseline Value (projected)**: ~$350K Year 1
- **ROI**: 6x (600%)
- **Case Study Use**: Shows Customer #2-3 the value realization they can expect

### Why Customer #1 Matters for Sales
1. **Social proof**: Actual customer, real implementation, proven value
2. **Case study**: One-pager shows $350K value potential (resonates with Customers #2-3)
3. **Reference call**: Can Customer #1 do warm intro to others in their industry?
4. **Sales velocity**: Customer #2-3 demos reference Customer #1 success

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Outreach Response is Low (< 5%)
**Action Plan**:
1. Increase outreach volume (add contractor SDR for 1-2 weeks)
2. Improve messaging based on feedback from early respondents
3. Shift to more warm intros (VP Sales makes direct calls)
4. VP Sales does LinkedIn outreach to top 15 targets (higher touch rate)

### If Discovery Calls Don't Convert to Demos
**Action Plan**:
1. Review discovery call recordings (AE coaching)
2. Improve demo messaging based on call feedback
3. Lower ICP threshold temporarily (75 → 70 score, wider funnel)
4. VP Sales joins calls to improve conversion rate

### If Customer #2 Demo Doesn't Happen by Day 15
**Action Plan**:
1. Identify 2nd-best prospect from discovery calls
2. Fast-track their demo to Week 9 (compress timeline)
3. Move Customer #2 to Week 10 demo (acceptable delay)
4. Ensure demos still happen—deal flow continues

### If Customer #2 Contract Stalls in Legal Review
**Action Plan**:
1. This is common—fully expect this
2. Move signature target to Day 1-7 Week 10 (not a failure)
3. Weekly CEO/VP Sales check-ins maintain momentum
4. Offer implementation start during negotiation (reduce risk perception)

### If Case Study Can't Be Completed by Week 9
**Action Plan**:
1. Push completion to Week 10 (before Customer #3 demo)
2. Publish teaser version early (Customer #1 early wins one-pager)
3. Prioritize customer approval process (most time-consuming step)
4. Marketing can finalize copy while CSM handles approval
