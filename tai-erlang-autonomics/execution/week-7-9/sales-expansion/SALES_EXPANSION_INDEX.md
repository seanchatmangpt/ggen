## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Outreach Falls Short
**Problem**: Not reaching 75+ touches per week
**Solution**:
1. Increase SDR team size or add contractor
2. Leverage warm intros more heavily (VP Sales makes calls)
3. Automate email scheduling (higher touch volume)

### If Discovery Calls Don't Convert
**Problem**: Low ICP scores, few qualified prospects
**Solution**:
1. Lower ICP threshold temporarily (75 → 70)
2. Adjust messaging based on call feedback
3. VP Sales joins calls to improve conversion rate

### If Customer #2 Doesn't Demo-Ready by Day 15
**Problem**: Demo with Customer #2 at risk
**Solution**:
1. Identify 2nd-best prospect as replacement
2. Accelerate that prospect's discovery → demo (Week 9)
3. Move Customer #2 demo to Week 10

### If Customer #2 Doesn't Close by Week 9
**Problem**: Expected close slips to Week 10
**Solution**:
1. Fully expected—likely outcome given sales cycles
2. Move signature target to Day 1-7 Week 10
3. Weekly CEO/VP Sales check-ins to maintain momentum
4. Offer implementation start during negotiation (reduce risk perception)
