## COLD OUTREACH STRATEGY

### Message Framework by Vertical

#### Vertical 1: Cloud Infrastructure / CPaaS
**Pain Points**: Multi-tenant governance, compliance receipts, entitlement bugs, latency >500ms
**Value Prop**: Cryptographic receipts + sub-50ms governance + audit trail for SOC2/FedRAMP
**Messaging**: "How are you handling multi-tenant governance at scale? TAI's receipt system removes compliance risk and sub-50ms latency."

#### Vertical 2: Fintech / Finance
**Pain Points**: Audit trail gaps, slow tier deployment (weeks), regulatory complexity
**Value Prop**: Cryptographic ledger + agile rule deployment (hours vs weeks) + continuous audit trail
**Messaging**: "How are you deploying rule changes and auditing transactions at your scale? We're helping fintech companies deploy in hours, not weeks."

#### Vertical 3: SaaS / E-commerce
**Pain Points**: Manual SKU management (40+ hours/month), inventory accuracy, stockout miss rates
**Value Prop**: Automation (80% manual work eliminated) + inventory accuracy (91% → 97%)
**Messaging**: "We're helping SaaS platforms reduce manual SKU management by 80% and cut stockout miss rates from 3.5% to 0.4%. Worth a conversation?"

### Outreach Templates

**Cold Email Template (Tier 1 - High Touch)**
```
Subject: Quick idea: automating [specific pain point] at [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I was reading about [Company]'s expansion into [vertical/geography], and it got me thinking about a common challenge we see at companies your size: [specific pain point].

We work with companies like [similar company] to [specific value: reduce manual work by 80% / deploy rules in hours / guarantee compliance audit trail], which typically results in [$X value] in Year 1.

Would be worth a quick call if you're open to a conversation? I can do [specific times].

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title, Company]
[Phone + Email]
```

**LinkedIn Message Template**
```
Hi [First Name],

Been following [Company]'s growth in [vertical] - impressive execution.

Quick question: how are you handling [specific pain point] at scale? We've built a system that helps companies like [similar company] [specific value], and I think there might be something relevant for [Company].

Open to a quick call this week or next?

[Your Name]
```

## NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### Customer #2 (Cloud/CPaaS) Negotiation Framework

**Anticipated Pricing**:
- Standard ACV: $150K-$300K/year (based on ARR size and user seats)
- Implementation: $25-50K one-time (30-45 day project)

**Common Objections & Responses**:
1. **"We have an internal solution"**
   - Response: "Understood. Most companies we work with tried that first. The key difference is [cryptographic receipts + multi-tenant scale + <50ms latency]. Want to see how it compares?"

2. **"Too expensive"**
   - Response: "ROI? Typical cloud platforms see $300K-$500K in Year 1 value (compliance risk reduction + latency improvement). What's your current spend on this problem?"

3. **"Can't change platforms right now"**
   - Response: "Totally get it. What's the timeline for your next refresh? We can work with that."

**Negotiation Levers**:
- Multi-year discount (3-year lock-in: -15%)
- Faster implementation (expedited project: +$25K but reduces time-to-value)
- Expansion revenue (start with 1 product, expand to others: locked pricing)

### Customer #3 (Fintech) Negotiation Framework

**Anticipated Pricing**:
- Standard ACV: $150K-$200K/year (based on transaction volume and compliance maturity)
- Implementation: $30-50K one-time (45-60 day project)

**Common Objections & Responses**:
1. **"We need a POC first"**
   - Response: "Absolutely. We can do a 30-day POC for $20K (applies to first-year cost). POC scope: [2-3 critical compliance rules + 1 transaction stream]. Does that work?"

2. **"Regulatory approval is slow"**
   - Response: "Yes, but we can parallelize: you get regulatory approval while we implement. Most fintech companies are live in 60 days."

3. **"This is a budget question"**
   - Response: "What would unlock budget? Is it tied to [H2 budget, new initiative, cost-avoidance]? We can timing to match."

**Negotiation Levers**:
- POC with credit toward first year (reduce early risk)
- Regulatory support (we provide compliance documentation for your regulators)
- Expansion pricing (lock pricing for new transaction types as they scale)

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk 1: Insufficient Discovery Calls
**Scenario**: Target 10 discovery calls not achieved by end Week 8
**Mitigation**:
- Increase SDR outreach to 125+ touches (wider funnel)
- VP Sales does direct warm intro calls (bypass SDR stage)
- Lower ICP score threshold temporarily (75 → 70, increase conversion)
- Extend discovery calls into Week 9 if needed

### Risk 2: Demo-Ready Prospects Not Qualified
**Scenario**: Customer #2-3 prospects don't emerge from discovery process
**Mitigation**:
- Identify "2nd best" prospect from discovery calls as backup
- Accelerate their demo schedule (compress discovery timeline)
- Move from ICP-perfect to "good enough" candidates
- Prepare to do 3rd demo in Week 10 (Customer #3 discovery → demo)

### Risk 3: Demos Don't Produce Buying Signals
**Scenario**: Prospects unimpressed by product demo or ROI
**Mitigation**:
- Schedule technical deep dives (address skepticism)
- Arrange customer references (other successful implementations)
- Offer POC as alternative to direct implementation
- Prepare discount/incentive for early adoption

### Risk 4: Contract Negotiation Stalls
**Scenario**: Customer #2 or #3 legal teams slow down signature
**Mitigation**:
- Begin contract review in parallel with demo (don't wait for end)
- Leverage standard terms aggressively (reduce custom negotiations)
- CEO/VP Sales involvement if deal stalls (shows commitment)
- Offer payment schedule flexibility (reduce upfront cost barrier)

### Risk 5: Warm Intro Pipeline Doesn't Materialize
**Scenario**: Expected warm intros from Day 2 onward don't convert
**Mitigation**:
- Cold outreach becomes primary funnel (has built-in buffer)
- VP Sales does direct outreach to warm intro contacts (higher conversion)
- Focus on SDR-generated discovery calls (more controllable)
- Accept that warm intros = bonus, not core requirement
