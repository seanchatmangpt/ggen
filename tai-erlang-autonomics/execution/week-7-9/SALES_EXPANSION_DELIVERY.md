## RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANS

### Contingency 1: Low Outreach Response Rate
**If**: Response rate drops below 5%
**Action**:
- Increase volume (add contractor SDR)
- Improve messaging based on feedback
- Shift to warm intros (VP Sales makes direct calls)
- VP Sales personal LinkedIn outreach to top 15 targets

### Contingency 2: Discovery Calls Don't Convert
**If**: ICP-qualified prospects not emerging from discovery calls
**Action**:
- Lower ICP threshold temporarily (75 → 70)
- Review and improve AE discovery call techniques
- VP Sales joins calls to improve conversion
- Adjust messaging based on call feedback

### Contingency 3: Demos Not Scheduled by Day 14
**If**: Customer #2 or #3 prospects not ready for Week 9 demos
**Action**:
- Identify backup prospects from discovery calls
- Fast-track their demos (compress discovery timeline)
- Move primary prospects to Week 10 (acceptable delay)
- Ensure demos still happen—don't skip this phase

### Contingency 4: Contract Negotiation Stalls
**If**: Customer #2 legal team delays signature beyond Week 9
**Action**:
- Fully expect this (common scenario)
- Move signature target to Day 1-7 Week 10
- Weekly CEO/VP Sales check-ins maintain momentum
- Offer implementation start during negotiation (reduce risk)

### Contingency 5: Case Study Delayed
**If**: Customer #1 case study not completed by Week 9
**Action**:
- Publish teaser version early (early wins one-pager)
- Prioritize customer approval (most time-consuming)
- Complete full case study by Week 10 (before Customer #3 demo)
- Marketing can finalize while CSM handles customer approval

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW CHECKPOINT

Every Friday at 4 PM (30-min team standup):

**Required Updates**:
1. Update UPDATED_PIPELINE_TRACKER.csv with latest prospect status
2. Create WEEK_X_SALES_SUMMARY.md with metrics and insights
3. Review outreach touches executed vs. weekly target
4. Review discovery calls completed vs. weekly target
5. Assess Customers #2-3 deal progress and probability
6. Identify blockers and adjustments needed
7. Confirm critical activities for following week

**Decision Framework**:
- If behind on outreach: increase SDR effort or recruit help
- If demos not scheduled: identify backup prospects for Week 9
- If negotiations stalling: escalate to CEO for relationship leverage
- If case study delayed: prioritize CSM bandwidth
