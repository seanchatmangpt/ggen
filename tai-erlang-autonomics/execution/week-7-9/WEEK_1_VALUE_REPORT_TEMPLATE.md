## DETAILED RESULTS BY VALUE STREAM

### 1. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY

#### Measurement Period
- Baseline: [Baseline measurement period, from signed baseline]
- Week 1: [Production dates, Days 19-21]

#### Key Metric: Manual Hours Spent on Entitlement/SKU Management

**Baseline**:
```
Team composition: [Description]
Hours per month: [X] hours
Cost per hour: $[Amount] (based on average salary)
Monthly cost: $[X]
Annual cost: $[Amount]
```

**Week 1 Measurement**:
```
Actual hours tracked: [Y] hours (extrapolated for full week)
Weekly projection: [Y] hours × 4.3 weeks = [Z] hours/month
Reduction: [X] - [Z] = [Reduction] hours/month
Cost per hour: $[Amount]
Monthly savings: [Reduction] × $[Cost] = $[Monthly]
Annual savings: $[Monthly] × 12 = $[Annual]
```

#### How TAI Eliminated These Hours

**Before TAI**:
- Manual SKU bulk uploads (spreadsheet-based)
- Manual rule creation (code review required)
- Error investigation and remediation
- Compliance checking (manual spot-checks)
- Manual reconciliations

**After TAI**:
- Automated SKU management (API-driven)
- Real-time rule enforcement
- Errors prevented automatically
- Continuous compliance checking
- Automatic reconciliation

#### Validation

**Customer Confirmation**:
✓ We tracked actual hours (via timesheets/system logs)
✓ Reduction is accurate
✓ TAI is responsible for the improvement

### 2. ERROR REDUCTION

#### Key Metrics: Compliance Violations & Data Quality Errors

**Baseline (90-Day Historical Average)**:
```
Type of Incident | Count | Cost Each | Total Cost | Monthly Avg
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Violation type] | [#]   | $[Cost]   | $[Total]   | $[Monthly]
[Error type]     | [#]   | $[Cost]   | $[Total]   | $[Monthly]
[Other type]     | [#]   | $[Cost]   | $[Total]   | $[Monthly]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL            | [#]   | —         | $[Total]   | $[Monthly]

Average incidents per month: [#]
Average cost per month: $[Amount]
```

**Week 1 Measurement** (First 3 days of production):
```
Type of Incident | Week 1 | Annualized | Prevented | Value
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Violation type] | [#]    | [#]/year   | [#] × 12  | $[Value]
[Error type]     | [#]    | [#]/year   | [#] × 12  | $[Value]
[Other type]     | [#]    | [#]/year   | [#] × 12  | $[Value]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL            | [#]    | —          | —         | $[Total]
```

#### Real Examples from Week 1

**Example 1: Compliance Violation Prevented**
```
Situation: Customer tier setting rule attempted to be applied incorrectly
Baseline: This would have affected [N] customers, cost $[X] to fix
With TAI: Rule validation caught error, prevented violation
Result: $[Amount] compliance cost avoided
```

**Example 2: Data Quality Error Prevented**
```
Situation: Inventory sync from data source had stale data
Baseline: This would cause [N] overselling incidents, $[X] loss
With TAI: Real-time validation rejected bad data
Result: $[Amount] in error costs avoided
```

#### Validation Through Cryptographic Receipts

Every action in Week 1 has a cryptographic receipt:
- Total receipts generated: [#]
- Total actions verified: [#]
- Validation success rate: 100%
- Attempted violations blocked: [#]

**Customer can verify**: Access audit trail anytime to confirm no violations occurred.

Weekly recovery: $[Amount]
Annualized run rate: $[Amount]
```

#### Financial Impact Calculation

**Inventory Accuracy Improvement**:
```
Baseline accuracy: [X]%
Week 1 accuracy: [Y]%
Improvement: [Z] percentage points

Orders processed Week 1: [N]
Errors prevented: ([X]% - [Y]%) × [N] = [Count]
Cost per prevented error: $[Amount]
Weekly savings: [Count] × $[Amount] = $[Weekly]
Annualized: $[Weekly] × 52 = $[Annual]
```

**Sync Latency Improvement**:
```
Baseline: [X] hour latency
Week 1: [Y] millisecond latency
Improvement: [Z]x faster

Missed sales from stale inventory baseline: [#] per month
Recovered sales from real-time accuracy: [#] per month
Average order value: $[Amount]
Monthly revenue recovery: [#] × $[Amount] = $[Monthly]
Annualized: $[Monthly] × 12 = $[Annual]
```

**Reduced Returns & Rework**:
```
Baseline returns from errors: [X]% of orders
Week 1 returns: [Y]% of orders
Reduction: [Z] percentage points

Return processing cost per order: $[Amount]
Monthly return cost baseline: [#] × $[Amount] = $[Monthly]
Current monthly cost: [#] × $[Amount] = $[Monthly]
Monthly savings: $[Previous] - $[Current] = $[Savings]
Annualized: $[Savings] × 12 = $[Annual]
```

- ✓ Industry-standard cost calculations

### Verification Process

✓ TAI metrics extracted and validated
✓ Customer baseline data reviewed
✓ Calculations verified against customer's manual records
✓ Discrepancies investigated and resolved
✓ Customer team confirmed accuracy

### Assumptions & Caveats

Key assumptions made:
