RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
================================================================================

Outreach Response Too Low (< 5%)?
→ Increase SDR volume, improve messaging, leverage warm intros

Discovery Calls Don't Convert?
→ Lower ICP threshold, improve AE techniques, VP Sales joins calls

Demos Not Scheduled by Day 14?
→ Identify backup prospects, fast-track to Week 9

Customer #2 Doesn't Close by Week 9?
→ Move to Week 10 (fully expected), maintain momentum, offer implementation start

Case Study Delayed?
→ Publish teaser early, complete full version by Week 10

================================================================================
