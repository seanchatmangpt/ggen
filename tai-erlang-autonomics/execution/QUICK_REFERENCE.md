## Critical Numbers (Memorize These)

|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Sales Cycle** | <60 days | Realistic if warm intros only |
| **POC Duration** | 14 days | Can extend to 21 if needed |

| **Win Rate** | >60% | Achievable with warm intros |
| **CAC** | $3.5K | All founder-led sales (cheap) |
| **LTV** | $775K | Multiple = 60% of customer value |
| **Payback Period** | 10 months | LTV/CAC = 221x |

| **Revenue Target** | $125K ARR | $50K + $40K + $35K = hit |

## Risk Mitigation Playbook

### If Sales Cycle Extends >60 Days
→ Shift to warm intros only
→ Extend POC to 21 days
→ Adjust Week 7 revenue estimate to Week 9-10

### If Customer Churn Happens
→ Increase CSM from 0.5 FTE to 1.0 FTE
→ Add weekly success reviews (not monthly)
→ Extend implementation by 2 weeks

### If MVP Delayed >1 Week
→ Use 1099 contractors (flexible capacity)
→ Defer features to Sprint 2
→ Delay sales launch by 1 week (no problem)

### If Hiring Stalls
→ Extend Week 3 offers (make signing more attractive)
→ Use 1099 backend engineers as backup
→ Partner with recruiting agency (expensive but fast)

### If First Customer Delays Payment
→ Require 50% deposit upfront
→ Net 30 payment terms standard
→ Consider monthly billing (reduces cash risk)
