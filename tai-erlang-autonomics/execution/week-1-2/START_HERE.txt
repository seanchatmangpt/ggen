FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

This package was designed for solo founders with zero legal/insurance
experience. You don't need an MBA or law degree. You just need to follow
the step-by-step plan and use the templates provided.

Everything is customizable. Everything has examples. Everything is explained.
You cannot do this wrong. You can only do it slower or faster.

The timeline is tight but achievable. 32-40 hours over 2 weeks is full-time
work, but every day is structured and every task is clear.

This investment in legal and insurance foundation now prevents 10x more
problems later. You cannot skip this. Insurance must be in place before
customer contracts.

Your success depends on:
1. Starting Monday (send three emails)
2. Following the daily plan (4-5 hours per day)
3. Meeting the Feb 7 deadline (all deliverables complete)
4. Having insurance in force (effective date Feb 7)
5. Having attorney-approved contracts (before first customer)

You can do all five. You have everything you need.
