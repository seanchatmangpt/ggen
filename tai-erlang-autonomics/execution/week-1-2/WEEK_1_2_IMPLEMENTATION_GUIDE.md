  Hi [First],

  Following up on our connection through [Mutual Contact]. I wanted to share something we're working on.

  At [Peer Company], we helped reduce their HIPAA audit resolution time from 6 months to 2 months
  by implementing cryptographic receipt ledgers for entitlement governance. This is exactly what
  I imagine could help [Their Company] with your compliance audit process.

  The biggest win for them: They can now prove every entitlement decision to auditors (SOC2, HIPAA, etc).

  Would you be open to a quick 20-minute call next week to see if this applies to your situation?

  Best,
  [Your Name]

  Hi [First],

  Great talking with you today about [pain point]. A few takeaways:

  2. SOC2 auditors have raised concerns about entitlement audit trail
  3. You're targeting [Timeline] to have a solution in place

  Here's what I propose: A 2-week POC to validate whether our autonomous governance
  can reduce your manual effort by 50%+ and add SOC2-compliant audit trail.

  If you're interested, let's hop on another call next week to scope the POC.

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

**If warm intro response rate is <40% (low)**:
- Double down on cold outreach (email + LinkedIn)
- Reach out to secondary connector contacts (ask for more intros)
- Skip companies with <70 ICP score to focus on best-fit prospects

**If discovery call acceptance rate is <30%**:
- Improve discovery call pitch (add more specific pain point + ROI)
- Use social proof more heavily ("Helped [Peer Company] achieve X")
- Offer more time flexibility (evenings, weekends for early conversations)

**If qualified lead rate is <8 (too low)**:
- Adjust ICP scoring (maybe 70+ instead of 75+)
- Follow up with borderline leads (ICP 70-75) for additional context
- Consider expanding to Tier 2 companies (10-50 score range)

---

## NEXT STEPS (Week 3 & Beyond)

**Week 3 Launch**:
- Customer discovery conversations begin (external)
- 20-30 discovery calls already scheduled
- 3-5 POC proposals in flight

**Week 3-4**:
- Move qualified leads to POC launches
- Target: 3 POC starts by end of Week 4
- Nurture remaining 5-9 leads
