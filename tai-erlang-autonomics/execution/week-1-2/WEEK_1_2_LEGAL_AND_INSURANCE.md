## 3. D&O INSURANCE (Directors & Officers)

### 3.1 D&O Quote Strategy

**Why D&O is Critical**:
- Personal liability protection for founder/directors
- Investor requirement (almost 100% of VCs require)
- Employment litigation protection
- Related cost: Usually $3K-$6K/year for startup

**Quote Template**:
```
Subject: D&O Insurance for Tech Startup

Dear [Broker],

Seeking Directors & Officers liability coverage for technology startup:

Company Details:
- Jurisdiction: [State]
- Number of Directors: 1-3 (founder + advisors)
- Annual Revenue: Projected $2M+ Year 1
- Employees: Solo founder, hiring 3-5 engineers by Q2
- Insurance Trigger: First employee/equity financing

Coverage Needed:
- Limits: $500K/$1M (expandable to $1M/$2M for funding round)
- Type: Side A (insured vs. insured), Side B (indemnified), Side C (corporate reimbursement)
- Side A Focus: Founder personal protection
- Premium Estimate: $3K-$6K annual

Timeline: Placement before first employee/investor engagement

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 3.2 D&O Policy Structure

**Standard D&O Policy has Three Components**:
1. **Side A** (Insured vs. Insured)
   - Directors sue each other
   - Personal liability of board members
   - Highest priority for early-stage companies

2. **Side B** (Indemnified Directors)
   - Company can't indemnify directors
   - Protects directors when company is insolvent
   - Important for startup protection

3. **Side C** (Corporate Reimbursement)
   - Company reimburses directors
   - Secondary coverage

**Recommendation**: Ensure policy includes solid Side A coverage (core founder protection)

### 3.3 D&O Placement Timeline

- Week 1: Get D&O quotes from same brokers
- Week 2: Select and place (usually simpler than E&O)
- Timeline: Faster underwriting (3-5 days typical)
