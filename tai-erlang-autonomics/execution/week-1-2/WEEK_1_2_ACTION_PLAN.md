## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Insurance Quotes Are Delayed

**Plan B (Option 1): Non-Admitted Carriers**
- Broker may use non-admitted carriers for faster underwriting
- Coverage is still valid and protected by state guaranty funds
- Typically faster placement (2-3 days vs. 5-7)

**Plan B (Option 2): Temporary CPLI**
- Some brokers offer temporary coverage while underwriting completes
- Bridges gap if underwriting extends past Feb 7
- Effective immediately pending final policy

### If Attorney Engagement Takes Longer

**Plan B (Option 1): Use Attorney Templates**
- Attorney provides templates rather than custom drafting
- You customize based on guidance
- Reduces legal costs and timeline
- Attorney reviews final versions

**Plan B (Option 2): Interim Attorney**
- Find alternative attorney for fast turnaround on entity formation
- Primary attorney handles ongoing matters
- Temporary arrangement only

### If Incorporation Is Delayed

**Plan B: Use Incorporation Service**
- LegalZoom or Rocket Lawyer offers 24-hour service
- Cost: $300-500 extra but guaranteed timeline
- Attorney can file Articles while service handles paperwork
