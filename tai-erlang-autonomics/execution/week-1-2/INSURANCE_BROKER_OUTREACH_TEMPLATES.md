## PHONE SCRIPT 2: Quote Evaluation Call

**Objective**: Understand quote details, negotiate terms, move toward placement

```
Hi [Broker Name],

Thanks for sending over the quote. I've reviewed it and have a few questions
to make sure we're comparing apples to apples across the three brokers I'm
evaluating.

Let me start by walking through the numbers:

E&O Insurance - I see you quoted $[AMOUNT]/year for $1M/$2M limits.
Can you confirm that includes the contractual liability endorsement?
[LISTEN]

I also noticed [SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT COVERAGE]. Can you clarify that
for me? [LISTEN]

On the D&O side, your quote shows [AMOUNT]. Does that include Side A
(insured vs. insured) coverage? That's critical for us. [LISTEN]

One more question - what's your typical turnaround time for claims?
Do you have a dedicated claims advocate for tech companies? [LISTEN]

[MOVE TOWARD DECISION]

Here's where we stand: I'm evaluating three brokers this week and need to
make a decision by February 3 to hit our placement deadline of February 7.

Your pricing is [COMPETITIVE / NEEDS REVIEW]. If you can [SPECIFIC
IMPROVEMENT], I'd be in a position to move forward with you immediately.

What flexibility do you have on pricing or terms? [LISTEN]

Thank you. Let me compare your final offer against the others and I'll
confirm by [SPECIFIC DATE/TIME].

Is the best contact for next steps still [PHONE/EMAIL]?

Excellent. I'll be in touch soon.
