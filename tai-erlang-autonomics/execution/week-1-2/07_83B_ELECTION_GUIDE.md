# 83(b) Election Guide - Restricted Stock Compensation

**Topic**: Tax Treatment of Founder Restricted Stock Grants
**Timeline**: Must file within 30 days of share issuance
**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

An 83(b) election allows founders who receive restricted stock to:
- Pay income tax immediately on the full value of restricted shares
- Avoid future tax on vesting (capital gains treatment only)
- Minimize long-term tax liability
- Reset capital gains holding period immediately

**Important**: This election can be extremely valuable for startups. Founder must file within 30 days of share receipt or lose the election forever.

## What is Restricted Stock?

Restricted stock is company stock that is:
- Subject to vesting (e.g., 4 years with 1-year cliff)
- Forfeitable (if founder leaves before vesting)
- Not immediately owned in full

**Without 83(b) election**:
- Founder pays income tax on vesting schedule (e.g., 25% per year)
- Founder owns shares but doesn't control them until vested
- Tax liability spans years 1-4

**With 83(b) election**:
- Founder pays income tax on Day 1 for full share value
- Founder fully owns and controls shares from Day 1
- Future appreciation is capital gains (lower tax rate)

---

## Who Should File 83(b)?

**File 83(b) if**:
- You are a founder receiving restricted shares
- Shares have a vesting schedule
- Stock price is low (inception valuation)
- You plan to hold shares long-term
- Tax liability is manageable in year 1

**Do NOT file 83(b) if**:
- Stock price is expected to drop significantly
- You cannot afford year 1 tax liability
- Shares are fully vested immediately
- Shares are non-forfeitable

## TAI Autonomics Founder Scenario

### Founder Grant Details

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Share Class | Common Stock |
| Shares Issued | 1,000,000 shares (per founder) |
| Vesting Schedule | 4 years with 1-year cliff |
| Issue Price | $0.0001/share (initial par value) |
| Inception Valuation | $0.0001/share or $100 total |
| Forfeiture Risk | Yes - if departure before vesting |

### Tax Calculation Example (Per Founder)

**Scenario 1: WITH 83(b) Election**

| Year | Event | Taxable Income | Tax Rate | Tax (assume 25% bracket) |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Year 1 | File 83(b), own 1M shares | $100 | 25% | $25.00 |
| Year 1-4 | Vesting occurs (no tax) | $0 | N/A | $0 |
| Year 4+ | Appreciation (if any) | Unrealized gain | Cap gains (15%) | Deferred |

**Total Tax if shares appreciate to $1M**: $25 + 15% tax on $999,900 gain = $25 + $149,985 = $150,010

**Scenario 2: WITHOUT 83(b) Election**

| Year | Event | Taxable Income | Tax Rate | Tax (assume 25% bracket) |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Year 1 | Nothing happens | $0 | N/A | $0 |
| Year 2 | 25% vests (cliff) | $250,000 | 25% | $62,500 |
| Year 3 | 25% vests | $250,000 | 25% | $62,500 |
| Year 4 | 25% vests | $250,000 | 25% | $62,500 |
| Year 5 | 25% vests | $250,000 | 25% | $62,500 |

**Total Tax if shares appreciate to $1M (and sell in Year 5)**: $250,000 + 15% cap gains on remaining $750,000 = $250,000 + $112,500 = **$362,500**

**Savings with 83(b) election: $212,490** (assuming full appreciation to $1M)

## Form 83(b) Timing - CRITICAL

|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Founder receives and signs Restricted Stock Agreement | Same day | CRITICAL |
| 1-5 | Prepare Form 83(b) with CPA/tax attorney | Day 5 | Ready |
| 6-15 | Sign Form 83(b) and deliver to Corporation | Day 15 | Ready |
| 16-20 | File copy with personal tax return or mail to IRS | Day 20 | Ready |
| 21-30 | Confirm IRS receipt or attach to tax return filing | Day 30 | Must complete |
| 31+ | **ELECTION LOST IF NOT FILED** | **Day 31 = TOO LATE** | **CRITICAL** |

## Tax Implications

### Income Recognition

**Year of Election**:
- Recognize ordinary income equal to FMV of shares on grant date
- FMV = Share price × Number of shares
- For TAI Autonomics: $0.0001 × [Shares] = [Income recognized]
- **Example**: $0.0001 × 1,000,000 = $100

### Tax Due

**Tax Liability Calculation**:
- Ordinary income: $100 (using TAI Autonomics inception valuation)
- Marginal tax rate: 37% federal + 13.3% California = 50.3%
- Tax due: $100 × 50.3% = ~$50
- Self-employment tax: $0 (not applicable to stock grants)

**Total Year 1 Tax**: ~$50 (minimal, given inception valuation of $0.0001)

**Note**: As company valuation increases, 83(b) becomes MORE valuable:
- If Series A at $1/share: Income = $1,000,000, Tax = ~$500,000 (if filed at that point)
- But if you filed at inception ($0.0001): Tax = ~$50, all future appreciation is capital gains

### Capital Gains Treatment

**After 83(b) Election**:
- Holding period starts on grant date (not vesting date)
- When you sell after 1 year: Long-term capital gains rate (15% federal max)
- Appreciation from $0.0001 to any future price: Capital gains (not ordinary income)

**Example**:
- Founder granted 1M shares @ $0.0001
- Files 83(b), pays $50 tax
- After 1 year, company raises Series A at $1/share
- If founder sells: Gain = $1M - $100 = $999,900
- Capital gains tax = $999,900 × 15% = $149,985 (far better than ordinary income treatment)

---

## Special Situations

### Scenario 1: Co-founder

If two co-founders each receive 1M shares:
- Each must file separate Form 83(b)
- Each recognizes own income and pays own tax
- Example: Both pay ~$50 each (total $100 year 1 tax for founders)

### Scenario 2: Future Round Increases Valuation

If Series A values company at $10M:
- Existing 83(b) elections filed at $0.0001 are PROTECTED
- No additional 83(b) needed
- New investors may file separate 83(b) for their grants at new valuation

### Scenario 3: Death/Disability Before Vesting

- 83(b) still provides income tax paid benefit
- Heirs inherit shares with stepped-up basis
- Vesting schedule may be waived depending on plan language

---

## CPA/Tax Attorney Involvement

### Strongly Recommended

TAI Autonomics founders should work with a CPA or tax attorney to:
1. Prepare Form 83(b)
2. Advise on tax timing
3. Ensure proper filing
4. Track basis for future capital gains
5. File annual tax returns with 83(b) attached

### Cost

- CPA review/preparation: $500-$1,500
- Tax attorney: $1,500-$3,000
- Cost is easily justified given tax savings potential

### Finding Professional

- Ask other founders for referrals
- Contact: American Institute of CPAs (www.aicpa.org)
- Look for: Experience with startup equity compensation
- Locations: San Francisco Bay Area has many startup tax specialists
