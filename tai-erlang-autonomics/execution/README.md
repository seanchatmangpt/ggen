## Common Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Sales Cycle Extends >60 Days

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on warm introductions only (higher close rate)
- Use extended POC (21 days instead of 14) if needed
- Target founders/ops decision-makers (not procurement)

### Risk 2: Customer Implementation Delays

**Mitigation:**
- Dedicated implementation manager per customer
- Weekly success reviews (not monthly)
- Contingency: extend go-live by 2 weeks if needed

### Risk 3: Product Issues Impact Customer Trust

**Mitigation:**
- 99.5% uptime SLA (monitor daily)
- Chaos engineering (test failure scenarios)
- Incident response plan (who responds in 30 min?)

### Risk 4: Hiring Delays

**Mitigation:**
- Offer extended Week 3 (not wait for Week 4)
- Use 1099 contractors as backup
- Partner with agency if internal search delays

### Risk 5: Fundraising Urgency

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-seed budget = $500K (12 months runway)
- Target customer revenue first (reduces cash urgency)
- Open Series A conversations Month 4-5 (not last minute)

## FAQ

### Q1: Can this plan be accelerated (60 days instead of 90)?

**A:** Unlikely without tradeoffs. The legal setup (W1) and MVP development (W2-5) are relatively fixed. Sales velocity could be accelerated with warm intros only (vs cold outreach), but customer implementation is 60-day minimum. **Realistic acceleration: 80-85 days with perfect execution + warm intro focus.**

### Q2: What if we don't hit Week 7 first revenue?

**A:** Common scenarios:
- Week 8-10: Sales cycle extended (normal)
- Week 10-12: POC extended (customer needs)
- Contingency: Extend runway by 6 months, reduce burn rate

**Action:** Weekly board call + adjust Q1 forecast. Do NOT panic or reduce quality.

### Q3: What if engineering is delayed (Sprint 1 not done by W3)?

**A:** Common causes:
- Hiring delay (offer Week 4, not Week 3) → use 1099 contractors
- Architecture complexity → simplify MVP scope (defer features to Sprint 2)
- Integration blockers (Shopify API issues) → escalate to Shopify support

**Action:** Extend MVP timeline by 1-2 weeks. Sales delay correspondingly. Re-forecast revenue for Week 8 (not Week 7).

### Q4: Should we do fundraising during these 90 days?

**A:** **NO.** Focus execution first. Use these 90 days to prove concept + get first customer. Series A conversations start Week 12-16 (after first revenue + reference customer).

**Why?** VCs will ask: "Prove you can acquire customers." First revenue + 3 customers = proof. Much easier fundraise.

### Q5: Do we need board meetings during these 90 days?

**A:** **YES, monthly only** (First Monday each month). Skip weekly board calls. Focus execution.

**Board Update Format:** 60-min slides covering: Revenue, Pipeline, Customers, Product, Team, Risks, Next 30 days.

### Q6: What if customer churn happens?

**A:** By design, churn probability is <5%. Why?
- Customer #1 in pilot phase (low risk of leaving)
- Customer #2 & #3 just signed (high motivation)
- NPS 8-9 (very satisfied)
- Implementation roadmap clear (customers know what's coming)

**Contingency:** If churn happens, increase CSM time to 1 FTE (not 0.5).
