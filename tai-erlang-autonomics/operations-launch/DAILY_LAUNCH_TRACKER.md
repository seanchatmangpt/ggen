## Quick Reference: Normal Baselines

Use these as your "everything is normal" baseline:

```
HEALTHY SYSTEM METRICS:
Error rate: 0.5% - 1.0% (occasionally spikes to 2-3%, then recovers)
Response time p95: 200ms - 500ms (normal for REST API)
Response time p99: 500ms - 1000ms (occasional slow requests)
Throughput: [Your baseline - measure first week] req/sec
Memory usage: < 50% of allocated (growing over time is normal)
CPU usage: < 30% average (spikes to 60%+ during peak load is ok)

PAYMENT PROCESSING:
Success rate: 98%+ (Stripe test account: 100% is typical)
Failed charges: Usually due to test cards or intentional failures
Average charge time: <500ms
Refund processing: <5 seconds

DATABASE:
Firestore read latency: 100-200ms (acceptable)
Firestore write latency: 150-300ms (acceptable)
Query time for top 100 receipts: <1000ms
Backup success rate: 100% (should never fail)

CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR:
Signups per day: [Your number - measure first week]
Churn per day: [Expect 0 first week, then small %, <3%/month is healthy]
Support tickets per customer: 0.5-1.0 per month is normal
Payment method add success rate: 95%+ (5% test cards fail sometimes)
```

## Alert Escalation Map

If you see this:
```
METRIC              THRESHOLD       ACTION
Error rate >1%      5+ min         🟡 Watch closely, investigate if >2%
Error rate >5%      5+ min         🔴 Page on-call engineer (P2)
Error rate >10%     1+ min         🔴 Page on-call engineer + VP Product (P1)
Error rate >20%     immediate      🔴 Fire all alerts: P1 + CEO + VP (CRISIS)

Response time       p95 >1000ms    🟡 Watch, investigate if sustained
Response time       p95 >2000ms    🔴 Page on-call engineer (P2)

Memory usage        >70%           🟡 Watch for memory leak
Memory usage        >90%           🔴 Restart service gracefully

Database latency    >2000ms        🟡 Watch Firestore status
Database down       any time       🔴 CRISIS - Page on-call + VP (P1)

Backup failure      any time       🟡 Page on-call within 1 hour
Backup >24h old     detected       🔴 Page on-call immediately (P1 data loss risk)

Payment failure     >5% of charges 🔴 Page on-call engineer (P1 - revenue at risk)
