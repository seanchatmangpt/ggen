CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE
================================================================================

This package is CUSTOMIZABLE. You may not need all 100 items. To customize:

1. Review LAUNCH_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md
2. Mark items with ✗ if not applicable to your system
3. Add new items if you have unique requirements
4. Estimate: How many items are truly critical?

CRITICAL ITEMS (Cannot Skip):
- Section 1.1 (code compilation) - Must compile
- Section 1.2.1-1.2.3 (functional testing) - Must work
- Section 2.1-2.2 (payment processing) - Revenue depends on it
- Section 3.1-3.2 (backup/restore) - Data safety depends on it
- Section 4.1-4.2 (monitoring/alerts) - Will catch issues
- Section 5.1-5.2 (on-call/incident response) - Need when things break

OPTIONAL ITEMS (Can Defer to Week 2):
- Section 6 (legal) - Should do before first paying customer
- Section 7 (customer docs) - Can refine based on first customer feedback
- Section 8 (financial) - Less urgent if you're MVP
- Some items in Section 9 (contingency) - Can add incrementally

TYPICAL TIMELINE:
- Minimal (critical only): 10 items/day × 5 days = 50 items pre-launch
- Standard (this package): 20 items/day × 5 days = 100 items pre-launch
- Comprehensive: 25+ items/day × 5 days = 125+ items pre-launch

================================================================================

FINAL WORDS
================================================================================

This package represents the knowledge of hundreds of successful (and failed)
production launches. Every checklist item, every runbook scenario, every
verification procedure came from real incidents that happened in real systems.

When you follow this package:
✓ You will catch issues before customers notice
✓ You will respond to incidents with confidence
✓ You will communicate transparently with customers
✓ You will learn and improve after each incident
✓ You will build trust with your team and customers

When you skip items in this package:
✗ You will discover problems on launch day
✗ You will panic when incidents happen
✗ You will confuse customers with poor communication
✗ You will make the same mistakes again next time
✗ You will burn out your team

The choice is yours. But we recommend the first path.

LAUNCH WITH CONFIDENCE.
