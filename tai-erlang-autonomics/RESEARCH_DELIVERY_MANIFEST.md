## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Insurance (Critical for Phase 2)
- **Policy Type**: Professional Liability (Tech E&O) with Contractual Liability endorsement
- **Limits**: $2M per occurrence / $2M aggregate (matches liability cap formula)
- **Cost**: $1,050/year ($88/month) for early-stage startup
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks from quote request to ACORD certificate
- **Recommended Brokers**: Marsh (fastest), Willis (deep relationships), Aon
- **Carriers**: Hartford (tech-native), AIG (proven), Travelers/Chubb (integrated)

### Revenue Recognition (ASC 606)
- **Eval Agreement**: $0 revenue (not a contract; AS-IS warranty; best-effort SLA)
- **Production MSA**: $X/month revenue (enforceable contract; SLA commitment; warranty implied)
- **Revenue Trigger**: MSA signed AND insurance certificate verified by customer
- **Financial Impact**: Revenue BLOCKED until insurance_audit_trail.verification_status = VALID

### Contract Framework
- **Liability Cap**: Lesser of $2M or 2x annual fees (completely insured)
- **Indemnification**: TAI indemnifies IP; Customer indemnifies misuse (both insured)
- **SLA**: 99.5% uptime, <24hr P1 support, <500ms response time
- **DPA**: Mandatory if customer uploads personal data (GDPR/CCPA)

### Audit Trail Control System
- **Three Components**: ACORD certificate + cryptographic hash + immutable database
- **Chain of Custody**: Day 1 eval → Day 90 conversion → Day 95 go-live
- **Insurance Verification**: Customer calls broker directly (not vendor-provided)
- **Database Schema**: SQL provided in Section 4.2 (insurance_audit_trail, revenue_recognition tables)

### Risk Management
- **12 Failure Modes Identified**: Insurance lapse, data breach, revenue without insurance, claim exceeds limit, etc.
- **Critical Controls**: Auto-renew insurance 90 days early, DPA mandatory, cryptographic verification
- **Monitoring**: Daily expiration checks, monthly compliance reports, audit-ready trail

### 90-Day Execution Plan
- **Week 1**: Insurance quotes + broker selection
- **Week 2**: Insurance underwriting + MSA drafting
- **Week 3**: ACORD certificate + audit trail database setup
- **Week 5**: First customer MSA signed + production go-live
- **Week 13**: Series A materials complete (insurance section)
