  M4-6:   25 customers,  $720K ARR,   -$84K net,   -40% margin
  M7-9:   40 customers,  $1.44M ARR,  BREAKEVEN,   -7% margin → PROFITABILITY!
  M10-15: 80 customers,  $3.6M ARR,   +$516K net,  +28% margin
  M16-20: 120 customers, $6M ARR,     +$1.07M net, +43% margin (AI premium)
  M21-24: 160 customers, $9.6M ARR,   +$1.69M net, +53% margin (federation lock-in)

Growth Rates:
  Customer Acquisition: 5 → 25 → 40 → 80 → 120 → 160 (32x in 24 months)
  Revenue Growth: $96K → $9.6M ARR (100x in 24 months)
  Net Margin Improvement: -66% → +53% (119 percentage points)

Unit Economics (Best-in-Class):
  Gross Margin: 98.8% (software)
  CAC: $5K (blended, decreasing from $3.5K)
  LTV: $150K+ (long retention + expansion)
  LTV/CAC Ratio: 88x (vs. 3-5x industry standard)
  Payback Period: 6-10 months (improving over time)
  NRR: 110%+ by Month 15 (expansion revenue exceeds churn)

Team Growth:
  Month 0: 5.5 FTE ($61K/month burn)
  Month 6: 8 FTE ($108K/month)
  Month 9: 9.5 FTE ($128K/month) ← Peak burn, then decreasing as % of revenue
  Month 15: 13 FTE ($184K/month) ← OpEx as % of revenue declining
  Month 24: 21 FTE ($297K/month) ← But only 21% of revenue

Funding Requirements:
  Pre-Seed: $500K (Months 0-5, 5-month runway)
  Series A: $1.5-2.5M (Months 9-20, raised after profitability proven)
  Series B: $3-5M optional (Month 24+, for acceleration)

Exit Potential:
  Year 3 Revenue: $9.6M ARR
  Typical Valuation: $100-150M (10-15x ARR multiple)
  Investor Return: 200-300x on $500K seed

================================================================================
THE THREE CRITICAL INFLECTION POINTS
================================================================================

Inflection #1: Month 9 - Platform Profitability
  What: Operating leverage kicks in as platform features reduce per-customer OpEx
  Revenue: $1.44M ARR
  OpEx: $384K/month (only 34% of revenue)
  Net Income: $0 → Positive (breakeven threshold)
  Impact: Proof point for Series A, company becomes self-sustaining

Inflection #2: Month 18 - AI Premium Pricing
  What: AI-powered features allow 15% pricing premium, drive expansion revenue
  Revenue: $6M ARR (from $3.6M at Month 15)
  Net Margin: 28% → 43% (15 percentage point jump)
  Key Driver: AI compute costs << premium revenue
  Impact: Defensible moat (proprietary ML models), reduces Series B funding needs

Inflection #3: Month 24 - Federation Lock-In
  What: Multi-vendor federation creates massive switching costs for enterprise
  Revenue: $9.6M ARR (from $6M at Month 20)
  Net Margin: 43% → 53% (10 percentage point jump to world-class)
  Key Driver: Network effects, enterprise lock-in, low churn
  Impact: Acquisition target becomes attractive, multiple expansion possible

================================================================================
GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY (By Vertical)
================================================================================

Vertical #1: E-Commerce (Primary - 60% of customers by Month 24)
  TAM: $20B (500K+ SMB e-commerce companies)
  Entry: Shopify API integration
  Pain: Manual inventory sync, 3-5% margin leakage
  Solution: Autonomous multi-channel orchestration
  ACV: $30-40K
  Target Customers by Month 24: 96
  Competitive Advantage: Better than Shopify (dynamic, not location-based)

Vertical #2: Healthcare (Secondary - 25% by Month 24)
  TAM: $10B (5K+ hospital networks)
  Entry: Expiration date tracking + cold chain monitoring
  Pain: $500K-2M annual waste from expired inventory
  Solution: Autonomous inventory optimization + alerts
  ACV: $40-60K
  Target Customers by Month 24: 40
  Regulatory: HIPAA compliance built-in

Vertical #3: Logistics (Tertiary - 15% by Month 24)
  TAM: $15B (5K+ 3PLs)
  Entry: LTL consolidation, hazmat routing
  Pain: 3-5% margin loss from freight surcharges
  Solution: Dynamic pricing for consolidation incentives
  ACV: $60-100K
  Target Customers by Month 24: 24
  Competitive Advantage: Vendor-agnostic federation (vs. Amazon siloed)

Blended Market Opportunity: $50B TAM (sum of above + marketplace, retail)

================================================================================

Month 9: Profitability Inflection
  Status: Net income turns positive
  Implications: Company no longer dependent on funding
  Proof Points: 40 customers, $1.44M ARR, unit economics proven
  Series A Timing: Ready to raise (Month 9-15)

Month 15: Series A Close
  Amount: $1.5-2.5M
  Use: Sales team expansion, enterprise features, geographic prep
  Milestones: 80 customers, $3.6M ARR, 110%+ NRR, 28% net margin
  Impact: Fund growth without burning seed capital

Month 24: Series B Ready (Optional)
  Status: Company self-sufficient and profitable
  Revenue: $9.6M ARR (100x from launch)
  Net Margin: 53% (world-class)

  IPO Path: Wait for $15M+ ARR at Month 30-36
  Founder Return: 200-300x on $500K seed

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION
================================================================================

Product Risks:
  🔴 RDF/SPARQL complexity limits adoption
     Mitigation: Pre-built templates, no-code UI, partner ecosystem handles complexity

  🟡 ML model drift (recommendations become stale)
     Mitigation: Continuous monitoring (Evidently), quarterly retraining, manual override

  🟡 Pricing rule conflicts (edge cases cause churn)
     Mitigation: Chicago TDD mandatory, comprehensive test suite, customer A/B testing

Market Risks:
  🔴 Well-funded startups copy the model
     Mitigation: Move fast (V1.0 in 3 months), data moat, network effects, partnership ecosystem

  🟡 Amazon or Shopify builds competing features
     Mitigation: Focus on specific niches, establish data moat early, federation as moat

  🟡 Enterprise adoption slower than forecast
     Mitigation: Start with SMB, build SEO/content, customer references drive momentum

Operational Risks:
  🔴 Key person dependency (Principal Engineer)
     Mitigation: Hire second principal by Month 9, cross-train teams, document architecture

  🟡 AWS cost overrun (ML training spirals)
     Mitigation: Budget limits, monitoring, auto-shutdown on threshold

  🟡 Customer concentration (1 customer = 30% ARR)
     Mitigation: Cap single customer at 20% ARR, encourage multi-customer integrations

Sensitivity Analysis:
  • If CAC rises to $6K (+50%): Payback period 10 → 16 months (still excellent)
  • If churn rises to 5%: Customer base 40% lower by Month 18 (concerning)
  • If acquisition 3 months slower: Profitability delayed to Month 12 (manageable)
