## Competitive Position

### vs. Shopify

- ✓ Autonomous optimization (Shopify = manual)
- ✗ Smaller ecosystem (Shopify = massive)

### vs. Oracle Netsuite
- ✓ Speed to value (TAI 2 weeks, Netsuite 6 months)
- ✓ Cloud-native (Netsuite = legacy)
- ✗ Smaller feature breadth (Netsuite = everything)

### vs. Amazon
- ✓ Vendor-agnostic federation (Amazon = siloed)
- ✓ Transparent pricing (Amazon = black box)
- ✗ Smaller data scale (Amazon = massive)

**TAM:** $50B+. Enough for multiple winners.

## Risk/Reward Profile

### Upside Scenarios
**If we execute perfectly (80%+ probability):**
- Month 24: $9.6M ARR, $100-150M valuation
- Acquirers: Shopify, Amazon, Flexport, Blue Yonder
- Investor return: 100-300x on seed

**If we accelerate (40% probability):**
- Month 24: $15M ARR (geographic + vertical expansion)
- Valuation: $150-225M
- Investor return: 300-450x on seed

### Downside Scenarios (Mitigated)

- Month 24: $4-6M ARR (but still profitable)
- Valuation: $40-90M
- Investor return: 80-180x on seed

**If profitability delayed to Month 15 (10% probability):**
- Requires additional seed ($750K) or bridge
- Delays Series A timeline 6 months

## Decision Framework

### Month 3 Review (V1.0 Complete)
**Questions:**
- Did we get to 3-5 customers? (Must-have)
- Is NPS >40? (Must-have)
- Are sales cycles <60 days? (Should-have)

**Decision:**

- **No → Pivot:** Revisit market, TAM, positioning

### Month 9 Review (Profitability Inflection)
**Questions:**
- Did we reach 40+ customers? (Must-have)
- Is net income positive? (Must-have)
- Is NPS >55? (Should-have)

**Decision:**
- **Yes → Series A:** Raise $1.5-2.5M, scale sales team
- **Partial → Extended Runway:** Profitable, can wait for better Series A terms
- **No → Reconsider:** Assess whether model is broken or just slower

**Questions:**
- Did we reach 80+ customers? (Must-have)
- Is NRR >110%? (Must-have)
- Is CAC <$4.5K? (Should-have)

**Decision:**

### Month 24 Review (Market Leader)
**Questions:**
- Did we reach 160+ customers? (Must-have)
- Is NPS >70? (Must-have)
- Is net margin >50%? (Should-have)

**Decision:**
- **Yes → Series B or Exit:** Raise $3-5M for international or accept acquisition offer

## Key Assumptions (Validate Quarterly)

1. **CAC Stability:** Assumed to rise modestly (3.5K → $5.5K) as market matures
2. **Churn:** <2%/month assumed (high retention due to switching costs)
3. **NRR:** 110%+ assumed (expansion revenue = 10-15% of base)
4. **ACV Growth:** +5-20% per phase (mix shift to premium tiers)
5. **Sales Cycle:** <60 days assumed for SMB, <90 days for enterprise
6. **Team Scaling:** Linear hiring (don't hit step changes in OpEx)
7. **Infrastructure:** Scales sublinearly (platform leverage)

**If any assumption breaks:** Update roadmap within 30 days
