## 15. RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Content Doesn't Resonate
**Mitigation**:
- Validate messaging with target customers monthly
- A/B test headlines and angles
- Adjust if needed (don't force messaging that doesn't work)
- Fallback: Pivot to narrower audience (e.g., just SaaS vs. broad market)

### Risk 2: Unable to Get Major Media Placements
**Mitigation**:
- Tier strategy: Publish on own blog if rejected
- Build audience first, then media will chase
- Leverage platform (Twitter, LinkedIn) as alternative to traditional media
- Fallback: Focus on niche industry publications

### Risk 3: Poor Podcast Booking Rate
**Mitigation**:
- Start with smaller podcasts (high booking rate)
- Build credibility, then pitch larger ones
- Create content that makes podcasters want to book us (good hooks)
- Fallback: Create own podcast instead of guesting

### Risk 4: Webinar Attendance Drops Off
**Mitigation**:
- Mix formats (some educational, some entertaining, some product demos)
- Bring compelling guests
- Strong email marketing to promote
- Fallback: Shorter, more frequent sessions (15 min instead of 30)

### Risk 5: Time Commitment from Founder
**Mitigation**:
- Hire content lead early (remove burden from founder)
- Batch content work (weekly recording sessions)
- Build templates so founder isn't starting from scratch
- Fallback: Co-founder or hired CEO takes more speaking load
