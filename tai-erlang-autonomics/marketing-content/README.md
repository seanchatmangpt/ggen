### Consistency

2. **First-Mover Authority**: By publishing first, we define what it means
3. **Long-Form Depth**: While others do sound bites, we publish 3K-4K word articles
4. **Data-Driven**: Research reports provide defensible proof
5. **Multi-Channel**: Consistent message across blog, social, podcast, conferences, video
6. **Community Built-In**: Developer relations, Discord, academic partnerships from day 1

## Questions?

**FAQ**:

**Q: Do we have to do all of this?**
A: No. Start with Articles 1-3, webinar series, and email. Add podcasts/conferences/research as budget allows. The framework is flexible.

**Q: What if we don't have $480K?**
A: Start with $150K (hire content writer, run email + blog only). Scale to $300K in month 3 once results prove ROI.

**Q: How long before we see results?**
A: Month 1: awareness. Month 2-3: inbound inquiries. Month 4+: pipeline impact. Track metrics weekly to optimize.

**Q: Do we need all 4 documents?**
A: Yes. ARTICLE_OUTLINES for what to write. THOUGHT_LEADERSHIP_PLAN for why/how. CONTENT_CALENDAR for when/where. README for overview.

**Q: Can we do this part-time?**
A: Not well. This is 3.4 FTE minimum. You can start with 1 FTE (content writer) and scale, but don't try to do it with less than 1 dedicated person.
