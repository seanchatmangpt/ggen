## POINT 8: REVENUE RECOGNITION & ACCOUNTING

### Checkpoint 8.1: ASC 606 Revenue Recognition

**Goal**: Proper accounting treatment of outcome-based revenue

```
ASC 606 REVENUE RECOGNITION CHECKLIST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[ ] Revenue Recognition Policy Documented
    Status: ✓ Documented ✓ Pending
    Policy covers:
    [ ] Base fee (fixed): Recognize immediately upon invoicing
    [ ] Outcome bonus (variable): Recognize only if:
        (1) Outcome achieved, AND
        (2) Reversal unlikely (constraint applied)

    Example policy language:
    "We recognize base fees upon service delivery (start of month).
     We recognize outcome bonuses only when:
     (1) Measurement confirms outcome was achieved, AND
     (2) We assess reversal as unlikely (>90% confidence)
     We apply constraint by reducing outcome bonus revenue by our
     estimated probability of reversal."

[ ] Constraint Analysis Framework
    Status: ✓ Established ✓ Pending
    Constraint principle: Only recognize variable revenue if reversal unlikely

    Analysis method:
    [ ] Step 1: Estimate probability of achieving outcome
    [ ] Step 2: Apply constraint (recognize only if >50% confidence)
    [ ] Step 3: Reduce revenue by 50% of bonus if <50% confident

    Example:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Base fee: $10,000 → Recognize $10,000 (100% - not contingent)

    Bonus if uptime >99%: $5,000
    Estimated probability: 75%
    Constraint analysis: 75% > 50%, so recognize with constraint
    Constrained amount: $5,000 × 75% = $3,750

    Journal entry:
      DR Accounts Receivable: $15,000
      CR Revenue: $13,750 (base $10K + constrained bonus $3.75K)
      CR Deferred Revenue: $1,250 (for remaining uncertainty)

    Next month: If outcome confirmed achieved:
      DR Deferred Revenue: $1,250
      CR Revenue: $1,250

      Estimated Q1 outcome bonus: $12,000
      Actual Q1 outcome: Only 95% achievement (partial)
      Actual bonus earned: $2,500
      Prior accrual: $12,000
