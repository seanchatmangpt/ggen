## Key Success Factors

### What Makes Day-One Monetization Possible:

1. **Insurance in Place** (CRITICAL)
   - Professional liability with contractual liability endorsement
   - Without this: Cannot sign outcome-based contracts
   - Timeline: 4-6 weeks (START WEEK 1)

2. **Objective Metrics** (CRITICAL)
   - Outcomes must be measurable, not subjective
   - "System uptime >95%" - Good
   - "Customer satisfaction" - Bad
   - Lack of objectivity = unenforceable contract

3. **Baseline Data** (CRITICAL)
   - 12+ months historical data
   - Establishes starting point
   - Customer must agree baseline is accurate
   - Without baseline: No proof of improvement

4. **Revenue Recognition Policy** (CRITICAL)
   - ASC 606 compliance required by auditors
   - Base fee: Recognize immediately
   - Outcome bonus: Recognize only if reversal unlikely
   - Finance team must be trained
   - Without policy: Revenue recognition errors

5. **Clear Contracts** (CRITICAL)
   - MSA reviewed by attorney
   - All exhibits completed (A-E)
   - Insurance certificate attached
   - Both parties sign original
   - Without this: Contract unenforceable

6. **Measurement Infrastructure** (HIGH)
   - Can extract customer data (APIs, logs, files)
   - Can calculate outcomes reliably
   - Can provide monthly reports
   - Without this: Cannot verify outcomes

7. **Customer Buy-In** (HIGH)
   - Customer believes in outcome alignment
   - Customer has data available for measurement
   - Customer values outcome focus
   - Relationship-friendly during new process
   - Without this: Customer disputes likely

### Red Flags (Do Not Proceed):

```
STOP if any of these are true:

[ ] Professional liability insurance not available
    → This is a show-stopper. Find different broker or accept non-outcome pricing.

[ ] Outcome metrics are subjective
    → "Significant improvement" is not measurable. Define objective metrics.

[ ] No baseline data available
    → Cannot prove improvement without baseline. Get 12+ months historical data.

[ ] Customer disputes measurement methodology
    → Revisit definition. Customer must agree methodology is fair.

[ ] Revenue recognition policy unclear
    → This creates audit problems. Document ASC 606 policy before first invoice.

[ ] Attorney says contract is unenforceable
    → Don't sign. Revise with attorney guidance. Risk is too high.

[ ] No measurement infrastructure in place
    → You cannot calculate outcomes. Must have data source & calculation process.
```

- ROI positive within 1-2 enterprise deals

### Q: When do we need independent board members?
**A**:
- Optional pre-Series A (founder can run alone)
- Required at Series A (investors demand governance)
- Best practice: Add 1-2 independent directors early (helps with governance)
