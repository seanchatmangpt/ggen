## Discovery Conversation Checklist (See DISCOVERY_CHECKLIST.md)

Use this to validate ICP fit during first conversations:
- [ ] Current annual effort spent on manual SKU management?
- [ ] Have you experienced entitlement compliance violations? Cost impact?
- [ ] How do you currently audit entitlement changes?
- [ ] What's your team's biggest pain point with current system?
- [ ] Budget for tools/infrastructure: annual approval process?
- [ ] Timeline to implement new solution?
- [ ] Who influences the decision? (Finance, Product, Engineering, Compliance)

## Competitive Positioning vs. Alternatives

| Alternative | Strengths | Weakness vs TAI |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual + Spreadsheets** | Free | 40+ hours/month, no audit trail, compliance risk |
| **Database Triggers** | Full control | Latency (>500ms), no receipt ledger, hard to scale |
| **Pub/Sub-only** | Flexible | No governance, loses events, no enforcement |
| **Open-source** (Apache Cassandra-based) | Low cost | Complex ops, no receipt ledger, latency issues |
| **Legacy entitlement system** (Oracle/SAP) | Proven | 6-month implementation, $1M+, rigid billing rules |

**TAI's advantage**: Autonomic governance + cryptographic receipts + <50ms latency + simple GCP deployment = 10x faster implementation, 5x lower TCO, 100x better audit compliance.
