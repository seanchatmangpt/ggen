## Messaging Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)

### LinkedIn First Message
```
Subject: Quick question about your entitlement management at [Company]

Hi [Name],

I came across [Company] and noticed you're scaling your product tiers.
We built an autonomic entitlement engine for companies like [similar company],
and it typically saves 40+ hours/month on manual SKU management while adding
compliance audit trails.

No pitch—just curious: How are you managing entitlements across your [N]
customer tiers today? Any pain points?

[Your name]
TAI Erlang Autonomics
```

### Cold Email (If No Response)
```
Subject: Helping [Company] reduce entitlement management overhead

Hi [Name],

Most [industry] companies spend 40+ hours/month managing entitlements manually.
At your scale, that's probably 2-3 people's full-time job.

We built TAI to automate that. In 30 days, companies typically see:
- 80%+ reduction in manual effort
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- <50ms entitlement checks (vs. >500ms with databases)

Would it be worth a quick 15-minute call? I'll come prepared with your
specific SKU structure in mind.

[Your name]
```

### Email After Demo
```
Subject: Your entitlement challenge—a potential path forward

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your time on our call today. Here's what stood out:

1. You're spending ~60 hours/month on manual rule changes
2. Audit trail gaps are slowing your compliance audits
3. You want to move faster on new pricing tiers

TAI is designed exactly for this. Here's what a 30-day POC would look like:
[link to POC charter]

Two quick next steps:
1. Schedule 30 min with our tech team to spec the POC
2. Start as early as [date]

Would [date 1] or [date 2] work for a quick tech call?

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Expansion Playbook (Year 1-2 ACV Growth)

**Goal**: 3x ACV within 12 months

**Tactics**:
1. **Departmental Expansion** (Identify adjacent teams in same company)
   - Example: SKU rules → Billing rules → Commission rules
   - Target: +20-30% ACV per customer

2. **Tier Upgrade** (Reactive as customer scales)
   - Monitor: Usage approaching tier limit (at 70%, alert customer)
   - Target: +50-100% ACV if scaling rapidly

3. **Feature Upsells** (New features released quarterly)
   - Advanced analytics, custom receipts, compliance certifications
   - Target: +$15-25K per customer

4. **Multi-Year Commitments** (At renewal)
   - Offer: 3-year lock at 15% Year 1 discount
   - Target: +10% deal value from commitment + lower churn

**Revenue Waterfall**:
```
Year 1: $600K (3 customers × $200K avg)
        ├─ +$120K (departmental expansion)
        ├─ +$45K (feature upsells)
        ├─ +$60K (multi-year commitment value)
        └─ +$1,050K (new customer cohort: 7 customers × $150K)

A: $150K/year (covers sales costs, customer success, product overhead)

**Q: Should we build a sales team or use agencies?**
