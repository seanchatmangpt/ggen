## ROI Examples (Why They Buy)

### Enterprise SaaS ROI Calculation
```
Current State:
├─ Team: 3 FTE managing entitlements
├─ Cost: 3 × $120K salary = $360K/year
├─ Impact: Slowing down product development
└─ Compliance: No audit trail for SOC2

With TAI:
├─ Cost: $150K/year (Growth tier)
├─ Benefit: 2-3 FTE freed up = $240-360K saved
├─ Compliance: ✓ Audit trail + receipt ledger (2-3 deal size impact)
└─ Agility: Ship new tiers in hours vs. weeks

ROI: ($360K - $150K) / $150K = 140% Year 1
     (Plus non-quantified: faster shipping, customer satisfaction)
```

### Cloud Infrastructure ROI
```
Current State:
├─ Revenue leakage: $2M/year (entitlement bugs)
├─ Customer churn: 3% × $50K MRR = $1.8M/year impact
├─ Latency: >500ms for quota checks = customer complaints
└─ Scaling: Can't handle 10k+ tenants efficiently

With TAI:
├─ Cost: $500K/year (Enterprise tier)
├─ Benefit: Protect $2M + prevent $1.8M churn
├─ Latency: <50ms (100x faster)
└─ Scale: Handle 10k+ governors seamlessly

ROI: ($2M + $1.8M - $500K) / $500K = 660% Year 1
```

### Fintech ROI
```
Current State:
├─ Compliance audits: $300K/year (6 months effort)
├─ Missed launches: 3 × $500K opportunity = $1.5M impact
├─ Manual rule changes: 2-4 weeks per change
└─ Audit trail: Gaps in entitlement tracking

With TAI:
├─ Cost: $250K/year (Growth tier)
├─ Benefit: Cut audit time 70% = $210K savings
├─ Launches: Now 3-4 weeks → hours (enable opportunities)
├─ Agility: 2-4 weeks → 2-4 hours
└─ Compliance: ✓ Irrefutable cryptographic receipt ledger

ROI: ($300K + $1.5M - $250K) / $250K = 640% Year 1
```

## Competitive Position

| Competitor | Weakness vs. TAI |
|---|---|
| Manual + Spreadsheets | No audit trail, 40+ hrs/mo wasted |
| Database Triggers | Latency >500ms, no receipt ledger |
| Pub/Sub Only | Loses events, no enforcement |
| Open-source | Requires ops, no receipt ledger |
| Legacy (Oracle/SAP) | 6+ months to deploy, $1M+ |

**TAI's Advantage**: Autonomic governance + cryptographic receipts + <50ms latency + 30-day deployment = 10x faster, 5x lower TCO
