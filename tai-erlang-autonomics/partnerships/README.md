## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

**For Enterprises**:
- 60-80% faster delivery through specification-first development
- 30-40% reduction in audit/compliance costs
- 100% deterministic, cryptographically verifiable code
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)

**For Partners**:
- Higher-margin service offerings (50-70% margin)
- Faster project delivery = better capacity utilization
- Differentiation in competitive markets
- New revenue streams from emerging use cases

**For Customers**:
- Single source of truth (RDF ontologies)
- Deterministic, reproducible builds
- Complete audit evidence and compliance proof
- Multi-language support with single specification

### Competitive Advantages

1. **Deterministic Code Generation**: Same input → bit-identical output (vs tools that iterate)
2. **Manufacturing-Grade Quality**: Poka-Yoke error-proofing prevents defects before they happen
3. **Compliance Automation**: Cryptographic receipts as audit evidence (vs manual documentation)
4. **Specification-First**: Catches ambiguity before coding (vs iterative approach)
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Chicago TDD, SLO enforcement, stop-the-line quality (Andon signals)

## FAQ

**Q: Why focus on partnerships vs direct sales?**
A: Partners provide 50:1 CAC:LTV ratio vs 10:1 for direct sales. Partners own customer relationships and can deliver 3-5x faster than ggen direct sales.

**Q: What's the difference between Diamond/Platinum/Gold/Silver tiers?**
A: Tiers reflect revenue potential ($50M+, $20-50M, $5-20M, $1-5M respectively) and depth of integration. Cloud platforms are Diamond (high revenue, high integration). Complementary tools are Silver (lower revenue, broader ecosystem).

**Q: How do you prevent channel conflict between partners and direct sales?**
A: Clear territory allocation, customer assignment rules, and escalation process. ggen maintains 30-40% direct sales portion, partners handle 60-70%.

**Q: What's the typical deal size for each partner category?**
A: Cloud platforms: $10K-100K average customer ASP. Systems integrators: $200K-500K per project. Compliance: $250K-500K per engagement. Consultancies: $1M+ per transformation project (ggen portion: 5-10%).

**Q: How are partner revenues tracked and reported?**
A: Monthly revenue reconciliation from partner (marketplace/software), payment in 30-60 days. Quarterly business reviews include revenue actuals vs forecast. Annual true-up for any discrepancies.

**Q: Can we have exclusive partnerships?**
A: Selective exclusivity for premium partnerships. Diamond tier (cloud): can restrict competing code generation tools. Platinum tier: can restrict within specific verticals. Gold/Silver: generally non-exclusive to maintain ecosystem breadth.
