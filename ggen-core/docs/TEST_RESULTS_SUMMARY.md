### ❌ **FAILED Tests (2)** - BUGS FOUND

#### Bug #1: Circular Hooks Not Detected (A ↔ B)
```
Test: test_circular_hooks_a_b_a
Status: FAILED ❌
```

**Configuration**:
```toml
[lifecycle.build]
command = "echo building"

[lifecycle.test]
command = "echo testing"

[hooks]
before_build = ["test"]
before_test = ["build"]
```

**Expected Behavior**: Should detect cycle: build → test → build

**Actual Behavior**: Test executed successfully! Both build and test ran.

**Error**:
```
thread 'test_circular_hooks_a_b_a' panicked at:
Error should show phases involved in cycle
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

Looking at `exec.rs::run_phase()`:
```rust
fn run_phase(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.enter_phase(phase_name)?;  // Adds to hook_guard
    let result = run_phase_internal(ctx, phase_name);
    ctx.exit_phase(phase_name);    // Removes from hook_guard
    result
}
```

**The Problem**: Hook guard is **exited too early**!

1. `run_phase("build")` → adds "build" to guard
2. Calls `run_before_hooks("build")` which calls `run_phase("test")`
3. `run_phase("test")` → adds "test" to guard
4. Calls `run_before_hooks("test")` which calls `run_phase("build")`
5. `run_phase("build")` → **"build" is already in guard** ✓ Should detect cycle!

BUT: The issue is that hooks run in `run_phase_internal`, which happens AFTER the guard check but BEFORE guard exit.

**Wait, let me re-read the code...**

Actually, looking at the hook execution:
```rust
fn run_before_hooks(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // ...
    for hook_phase in hooks_list {
        run_phase(ctx, hook_phase)?;  // <-- This should add to guard
    }
}
```

The problem is that `run_phase("test")` is called from within `run_phase("build")`, but the guard check happens BEFORE hooks are executed.

**Actually, the real issue**:

Looking more carefully:
1. `run_phase("build")` enters → guard = {"build"}
2. Runs `run_phase_internal("build")`
3. In `run_phase_internal`, calls `run_before_hooks("build")`
4. `run_before_hooks` calls `run_phase("test")`
5. `run_phase("test")` enters → guard = {"build", "test"}
6. Runs `run_phase_internal("test")`
7. In `run_phase_internal("test")`, calls `run_before_hooks("test")`
8. `run_before_hooks("test")` calls `run_phase("build")`
9. `run_phase("build")` enters → **"build" already in guard!** Should detect!

So the guard SHOULD work... but the test failed. Let me check if the hooks are actually being called.

**WAIT!** I see the issue now. Looking at the test failure, it says:
```
Error should show phases involved in cycle
```

This means an error WAS returned, but it doesn't contain both "build" and "test" in the error message!

The current error is probably:
```
Hook recursion detected: phase 'build' called recursively
```

But it doesn't show the chain: build → test → build

**Fix Required**:
```rust
// In error.rs
#[error("Hook recursion detected: phase '{phase}' in call chain: {}", chain.join(" -> "))]
HookRecursion { phase: String, chain: Vec<String> },
```

And track the full call chain in the guard.

#### Bug #2: Deep Circular Chain Not Detected
```
Test: test_circular_hooks_deep_chain
Status: FAILED ❌
```

**Configuration**:
```toml
[lifecycle.a]
command = "echo a"
[lifecycle.b]
command = "echo b"
[lifecycle.c]
command = "echo c"
[lifecycle.d]
command = "echo d"

[hooks]
before_a = ["b"]
before_b = ["c"]
before_c = ["d"]
before_d = ["a"]
```

**Expected Behavior**: Should detect cycle: a → b → c → d → a

**Actual Behavior**:
```
▶️  Running phase: a
✅ Phase 'a' completed in 473ms

thread 'test_circular_hooks_deep_chain' panicked at:
Should detect deep circular dependency
```

**WAIT!** Phase 'a' COMPLETED successfully! That means NO error was thrown at all!

This is a **CRITICAL BUG** - the hook guard is NOT working for deep chains.

**Root Cause**: The guard only detects IMMEDIATE recursion (same phase called twice), but not TRANSITIVE recursion (a → b → c → a).

**Why?**:

Let's trace through:
1. `run_phase("a")` → guard = {"a"}
2. Calls `run_before_hooks("a")` → calls `run_phase("b")`
3. `run_phase("b")` → guard = {"a", "b"}
4. Calls `run_before_hooks("b")` → calls `run_phase("c")`
5. `run_phase("c")` → guard = {"a", "b", "c"}
6. Calls `run_before_hooks("c")` → calls `run_phase("d")`
7. `run_phase("d")` → guard = {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
8. Calls `run_before_hooks("d")` → calls `run_phase("a")`
9. `run_phase("a")` → **"a" is in guard!** Should detect!

BUT the test says it completed successfully...

**AH! I found it!** Looking at the code again:

```rust
fn exit_phase(&self, phase: &str) {
    if let Ok(mut guard) = self.hook_guard.lock() {
        guard.remove(phase);
    }
}
```

The guard is **removed** when a phase completes! So:

1. Phase "b" completes → removes "b" from guard
2. Phase "c" completes → removes "c" from guard
3. Phase "d" starts → guard = {"a"}
4. Phase "d" calls "a" → "a" is in guard → **Should detect!**

Wait, this should still work...

**Let me re-trace more carefully**:

Actually, I think the issue is the order of operations:

1. `run_phase("a")`:
   - `enter_phase("a")` → guard = {"a"}
   - `run_phase_internal("a")`:
     - `run_before_hooks("a")` → calls `run_phase("b")`
   - **After hooks return**, `exit_phase("a")` → guard = {}

So by the time "b" completes and control returns to "a", "a" has already been removed from the guard!

**The Fix**: Don't remove from guard until ALL hooks have completed:

```rust
fn run_phase_internal(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Run before hooks BEFORE entering phase in guard
    run_before_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;

    // Now enter guard (after hooks)
    ctx.enter_phase(phase_name)?;

    // Execute phase
    // ...

    ctx.exit_phase(phase_name);

    // Run after hooks
    run_after_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;
}
```

No wait, that doesn't help either...

**ACTUAL PROBLEM**: The guard is scoped to the `run_phase` call, not to the hook execution! Once `run_phase("b")` returns, "b" is removed from the guard, even though we're still in the middle of executing "a"'s hooks!

**The Real Fix**: The guard should track the **call stack**, not just active phases. Or, don't remove phases from the guard until the TOP-LEVEL phase completes.

**Correct Implementation**:

```rust
fn run_phase(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.enter_phase(phase_name)?;

    // Use a guard to ensure exit_phase is called even on error
    let _guard = scopeguard::guard(ctx, |ctx| {
        ctx.exit_phase(phase_name);
    });

    run_phase_internal(ctx, phase_name)
}
```

Actually, that's already how it works (via the manual exit_phase call).

**OK, I think I finally see it**:

The problem is in the ORDER of operations in `run_phase_internal`:

```rust
fn run_phase_internal(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Run before hooks
    run_before_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;

    // 2. Execute phase commands
    // ...

    // 3. Update state
    // ...

    // 4. Run after hooks
    run_after_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

And `run_phase` is:
```rust
fn run_phase(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.enter_phase(phase_name)?;
    let result = run_phase_internal(ctx, phase_name);
    ctx.exit_phase(phase_name);  // <-- Removes from guard!
    result
}
```

So when `run_phase("b")` completes (called from "a"'s before hooks), it removes "b" from the guard BEFORE returning to "a"!

This is correct for detecting immediate recursion but WRONG for detecting transitive cycles.

**Solution**: The guard should persist until the ENTIRE call tree completes, not just the immediate call.

**Correct Fix**:

Don't remove phases from the guard until after ALL hooks (before and after) have completed:

```rust
fn run_phase(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.enter_phase(phase_name)?;

    let result = (|| {
        run_before_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;
        execute_phase_commands(...)?;
        run_after_hooks(ctx, phase_name)?;
        Ok(())
    })();

    ctx.exit_phase(phase_name);
    result
}
```

Wait, that's the same thing...

**AH! I SEE IT NOW!**

The issue is that when we call `run_phase("b")` from within "a"'s before hooks, "b" gets added to the guard, then REMOVED when it completes, BEFORE we return to "a".

So the guard is empty when "b" tries to call "a" again!

No wait, "a" is still in the guard because we haven't exited "a" yet...

Let me trace through one more time, very carefully:

```
run_phase("a"):
  enter_phase("a") → guard = {"a"}
  run_phase_internal("a"):
    run_before_hooks("a"):
      run_phase("b"):
        enter_phase("b") → guard = {"a", "b"}
        run_phase_internal("b"):
          run_before_hooks("b"):
            run_phase("c"):
              enter_phase("c") → guard = {"a", "b", "c"}
              run_phase_internal("c"):
                run_before_hooks("c"):
                  run_phase("d"):
                    enter_phase("d") → guard = {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
                    run_phase_internal("d"):
                      run_before_hooks("d"):
                        run_phase("a"):
                          enter_phase("a") → "a" already in guard! ✅ SHOULD DETECT!
```

So theoretically it SHOULD work...

**BUT THE TEST SAYS IT DOESN'T!**

Let me look at the test output again:
```
▶️  Running phase: a
✅ Phase 'a' completed in 473ms
```

So "a" completed successfully... which means the cycle was NOT detected.

**HYPOTHESIS**: Maybe the hooks aren't actually running? Let me check the make.toml syntax...

```toml
[hooks]
before_a = ["b"]
```

**AH HA!** The hooks in make.toml use phase names like `before_build`, `before_test`, etc., but NOT arbitrary phase names like `before_a`!

Looking at `exec.rs::run_before_hooks`:
```rust
let before_hooks = match phase_name {
    "init" => &hooks.before_init,
    "setup" => &hooks.before_setup,
    "build" => &hooks.before_build,
    "test" => &hooks.before_test,
    "deploy" => &hooks.before_deploy,
    _ => &None,  // <-- Arbitrary phases have NO hooks!
};
```

**THERE'S THE BUG!** Hooks only work for PREDEFINED phases (init, setup, build, test, deploy), not for custom phases!

So `before_a` is ignored, and the cycle never happens!

**Fix Required**:
```rust
// In model.rs - Make hooks dynamic
pub struct Hooks {
    pub before_all: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_all: Option<Vec<String>>,
    // ... existing fields ...

    // Add dynamic hooks
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub dynamic: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

// In exec.rs
fn run_before_hooks(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(hooks) = &ctx.make.hooks {
        // Check dynamic hooks
        let hook_key = format!("before_{}", phase_name);
        if let Some(hook_phases) = hooks.dynamic.get(&hook_key) {
            for hook_phase in hook_phases {
                run_phase(ctx, hook_phase)?;
            }
        }

        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Support Dynamic Hook Names (P0)
**Priority**: CRITICAL ⚠️

**Current Code** (`src/lifecycle/model.rs`):
```rust
pub struct Hooks {
    pub before_all: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_all: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub before_init: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub before_setup: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub before_build: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub before_test: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub before_deploy: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_init: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_setup: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_build: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_test: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_deploy: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
```

**Problem**: Hardcoded phase names, no support for custom phases

**Fix**:
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Hooks {
    // Global hooks
    pub before_all: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub after_all: Option<Vec<String>>,

    // Phase-specific hooks (dynamic)
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub phase_hooks: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

// In exec.rs
fn run_before_hooks(ctx: &Context, phase_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(hooks) = &ctx.make.hooks {
        // Global before_all
        if let Some(before_all) = &hooks.before_all {
            for hook_phase in before_all {
                run_phase(ctx, hook_phase)?;
            }
        }

        // Dynamic before_{phase}
        let hook_key = format!("before_{}", phase_name);
        if let Some(hook_phases) = hooks.phase_hooks.get(&hook_key) {
            for hook_phase in hook_phases {
                run_phase(ctx, hook_phase)?;
            }
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Testing**: Re-run `test_circular_hooks_deep_chain` - should now detect the cycle

---

### Fix #2: Improve Error Messages (P1)
**Priority**: HIGH 🔥

**Current Code** (`src/lifecycle/exec.rs`):
```rust
fn enter_phase(&self, phase: &str) -> Result<()> {
    let mut guard = self.hook_guard.lock().unwrap();

    if guard.contains(phase) {
        return Err(LifecycleError::hook_recursion(phase));
    }

    guard.insert(phase.to_string());
    Ok(())
}
```

**Problem**: Error only shows the recursive phase, not the full call chain

**Fix**:
```rust
// Add call chain tracking to Context
pub struct Context {
    // ... existing fields ...
    call_chain: Arc<Mutex<Vec<String>>>,
}

fn enter_phase(&self, phase: &str) -> Result<()> {
    let mut guard = self.hook_guard.lock().unwrap();
    let mut chain = self.call_chain.lock().unwrap();

    if guard.contains(phase) {
        // Build full cycle chain
        let cycle_start = chain.iter().position(|p| p == phase).unwrap();
        let cycle = chain[cycle_start..].to_vec();
        cycle.push(phase.to_string()); // Close the cycle

        return Err(LifecycleError::hook_recursion_with_chain(
            phase.to_string(),
            cycle
        ));
    }

    guard.insert(phase.to_string());
    chain.push(phase.to_string());
    Ok(())
}

fn exit_phase(&self, phase: &str) {
    if let Ok(mut guard) = self.hook_guard.lock() {
        guard.remove(phase);
    }
    if let Ok(mut chain) = self.call_chain.lock() {
        chain.pop();
    }
}
```

**Expected Error**:
```
Hook recursion detected: phase 'build' in call chain: build -> test -> build
```
