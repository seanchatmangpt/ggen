## Key Concepts Across Documents

### Holographic Principle
```
Film (RDF Ontology O):
  - High-dimensional interference pattern (~10,000 dimensions)
  - Hypervector space via circular convolution (S ⊛ P ⊛ O)
  - Single source of truth
  - [Discussed in: BIG_BANG_80_20_HOLOGRAPHIC, HOLOGRAPHIC_ROADMAP]

Laser (Measurement Function μ):
  - Deterministic: Normalize → Extract → Emit → Canonicalize → Receipt
  - Different angles → different projections
  - Templates, SPARQL queries, target language
  - [Discussed in: HOLOGRAPHIC_GAP_ANALYSIS, HARNESSING_ENTROPY]

Hologram (Generated Code A):
  - 2D projection of high-dimensional pattern
  - Different lasers → different but equally valid A
  - All preserve semantic fidelity (Φ = 1.0) if O is closed
  - [Discussed in: BIG_BANG_80_20_HOLOGRAPHIC, SPECIFICATION_ENTROPY]
```

### Specification Entropy
```
H(O) = log₂(number of possible instantiations)

Bounded: H(O) ≤ 20 bits → ~1 million configurations max
Closure: Specification is complete, all valid projections possible
Runaway: Without damping, H grows unboundedly
[Discussed in: SPECIFICATION_ENTROPY_RUNAWAY, HARNESSING_ENTROPY, HOLOGRAPHIC_GAP]
```

### Damping Mechanisms
```
Passive (Validation Gates):
  - Entropy bound (reject if H > 20)
  - Coherence monitoring (detect φ < 1.0)
  - Type preservation (Rust compiler)
  - SHACL validation (RDF schema)
  - Chicago TDD tests (behavioral verification)
  - [Discussed in: SPECIFICATION_ENTROPY_RUNAWAY, HOLOGRAPHIC_ROADMAP]

Active (LLM Reasoning):
  - Semantic compression (ggen-ai)
  - Intent extraction (preserve minimality)
  - Fidelity validation (understand purpose)
  - Spec refinement (guided improvement)
  - Multi-angle synthesis (convergence)
  - [Discussed in: HARNESSING_ENTROPY_WITH_GGEN_AI]
```

### Multi-Angle Architecture
```
One ontology O:
  ├→ μ₁ (TypeScript): Express API
  ├→ μ₂ (Go): gRPC services
  ├→ μ₃ (Python): FastAPI backend
  └→ μ₄ (Kubernetes): Deployment manifests

Result: All stay in perfect sync (same O)
Evolution: Update O once, all projections regenerate
[Discussed in: BIG_BANG_80_20_HOLOGRAPHIC, HOLOGRAPHIC_GAP_ANALYSIS]
```

### EPIC 9 + Holographic
```
Classic EPIC 9 (Newtonian):
  10 agents generate code to verify closure (redundant work)

Holographic EPIC 9:
  10 agents explore different measurement angles (μ₁, μ₂, ... μ₁₀)
  Each generates valid projection from same O
  Collision detection: Do all preserve semantic fidelity?
  Convergence: Synthesize optimal multi-angle deployment
  [Discussed in: BIG_BANG_80_20_HOLOGRAPHIC, HARNESSING_ENTROPY]
```

## Critical Insights

### Insight 1: Code is Projection, Not Computation
```
Traditional View:
  Spec → [COMPUTE] → Unique, predetermined code

Holographic View:
  Spec (film) ↓
    → [Angle 1] → Projection A₁ (TypeScript)
    → [Angle 2] → Projection A₂ (Go)
    → [Angle 3] → Projection A₃ (Python)
    All equally valid, all preserve intent

This changes everything about how we think about code generation.
[Source: BIG_BANG_80_20_HOLOGRAPHIC_ARCHITECTURE.md]
```

### Insight 2: Expansion is Natural, But Must Be Damped
```
Code inherently richer than spec:
  Spec: 10 triples
  Code: 850 bits of information

Without damping:
  Code → Extract spec → More complex spec
         → Code → More complex spec
         → Explosion

With damping (entropy bound + LLM reasoning):
  Stable equilibrium at H(O) ≈ 20 bits
  Refinement is bounded, intentional, semantic

This explains why constitution is non-negotiable.
[Source: SPECIFICATION_ENTROPY_RUNAWAY.md, HARNESSING_ENTROPY_WITH_GGEN_AI.md]
```

### Insight 3: LLMs are Semantic Compressors
```
Without ggen-ai:
  Code → [Extract all relationships] → Bloated spec

With ggen-ai:
  Code + Intent → [LLM reasoning] → Minimal spec
  "What's the *essential* spec that generates this code?"

LLMs understand *purpose*, not just syntax.
This is the key to safe feedback loops.
[Source: HARNESSING_ENTROPY_WITH_GGEN_AI.md]
```

### Insight 4: Stability is an Engineering Choice
```
Thermal runaway in fusion: Natural unless prevented
Entropy runaway in code gen: Natural unless prevented

Both require:
  1. Understanding the dynamics (ODEs)
  2. Identifying damping mechanisms
  3. Tuning damping to match expansion
  4. Monitoring in real-time

The constitution is the tuning system.
