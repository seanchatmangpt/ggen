folk:Zombie
    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Positive unit economics (not burning cash) but insufficient growth:

folk:Serendipity
    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Multiplicative effect of preparation × random encounter:
        Serendipity_value ∝ preparation_level × random_event_relevance
        Mathematically: filtering process where only relevant random events produce advantage
        Highly prepared entrepreneurs: 10x more likely to 'get lucky' when opportunity arrives" ;
    folk:formula "Success_via_luck = baseline_luck × (1 + preparation_amplification_factor)

    folk:examples "YouTube founders (video sharing): prior experience with payment systems (PayPal) enabled rapid scaling when viral" ;
    folk:BiasWarning "Survivors attribute success to serendipity; non-survivors attribute failure to bad luck (blame asymmetry)" .

folk:Luck
    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Uncontrollable random event that creates significant expected value change:
        luck_impact = random_event_value - expected_value_without_event
        |luck_impact| > 10% of current_value constitutes material luck
        Occurs ~40% of high-growth companies at some point (empirically)" ;

folk:Connections
    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Network effects in social capital: opportunity_access ∝ connection_density × connection_quality
        Graph centrality measures: betweenness centrality, closeness centrality
        Value: high-centrality founder → 10-100x more business opportunity exposure" ;

    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Resource concentration on subset of opportunity space:

folk:Culture
    folk:mathematicalDefinition "Shared behavioral attractors guiding autonomous decision-making:
        culture_strength = correlation(individual_decisions, culture_ideals)
        Strong culture: decisions automatically aligned (>0.8 correlation)
