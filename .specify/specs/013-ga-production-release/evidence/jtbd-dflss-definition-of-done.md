## Part 1: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

### JTBD Framework Applied to ggen v5.1.0

**Job**: "I want to synchronize my domain ontology changes with generated code deterministically"

#### The Functional Job
- **Primary**: Transform RDF ontologies + templates → reproducible code
- **Secondary**: Track changes (audit trail) for compliance
- **Tertiary**: Allow human+machine collaboration (merge mode)

#### The Emotional Job
- **Want**: Trust the tool completely (safety-first)
- **Want**: Fast feedback loop (developer experience)
- **Want**: Clear error messages (no guessing)

#### The Social Job
- **Want**: Team collaboration (manual + generated code)
- **Want**: Compliance verification (audit trail)
- **Want**: Reproducible builds (for CI/CD)
