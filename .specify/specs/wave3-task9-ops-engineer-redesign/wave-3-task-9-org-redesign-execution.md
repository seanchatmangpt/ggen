# Wave 3 Task 9: Ops Engineer 2.0 Organizational Redesign - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive 12-week transition plan for the Ops Engineer 2.0 organizational redesign, taking 200+ Disney operations engineers from a task-assignment model (800 headcount, 30 reporting lines) to a process-architecture model (500 headcount, 10 reporting lines).

**Key Outcomes:**
- **Headcount Reduction**: 800 → 500 (300 FTE via productivity gains, NOT layoffs)
- **Organizational Flattening**: 30 reporting lines → 10 (more autonomous teams)
- **Manager Role Transformation**: Task assignment → Process architecture & career development
- **Career Path Clarity**: 50% of engineers see clear advancement opportunity within 24 months
- **Retention Control**: < 5% attrition spike (target: remain at baseline ~8% annual, or <10% during transition)
- **Manager Acceptance**: > 70% satisfaction with new role model
- **Operational Continuity**: > 98% ops success rate maintained throughout

**Delivery Timeline**: January 20 - April 12, 2026 (12 weeks)

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis (Weeks 1-2)

### Objective
Understand current organizational capabilities, identify high performers, assess transition readiness, and create engineer cohorts for targeted transition strategies.

### Activities

#### 1.1 Performance Data Audit (Owner: HR Analytics + VP Ops)
- **Scope**: Review last 12 months of performance data for all 800 engineers
- **Data Points**: Performance ratings, promotion eligibility, skill assessments, manager feedback
- **Output**:
  - Performance distribution (% in each rating tier)
  - High performer list (top 15% = ~120 engineers)
  - Development candidates (emerging talent = ~80 engineers)

#### 1.2 Skills Inventory Assessment (Owner: Ops Leadership)
- **Scope**: Categorize engineers by technical domain, leadership capability, interpersonal skills
- **Method**:
  - Manager surveys (30 minutes each × 30 managers = 15 hours)
  - Self-assessment survey (15 min × 800 engineers = 200 hours)
  - Peer review sessions (informal conversations, 10 hours)
- **Output**: Skills matrix × 800 engineers (100+ skill dimensions)

#### 1.3 Readiness Assessment (Owner: VP Ops + Managers)
- **Scope**: Evaluate each engineer's readiness for new roles, autonomy level, learning agility
- **Criteria**:
  - Current capability level (IC1-IC6 equivalent)
  - Readiness for increased autonomy (vs. need for detailed guidance)
  - Promotion readiness for next level within 6-12 months
  - Retention risk (flight risk, external opportunities, internal motivation)
- **Output**: Cohort assignments (C1: 80, C2: 150, C3: 30, C4: 40)

#### 1.4 Retention Risk Mapping (Owner: HR + VP Ops)
- **Scope**: Model which engineers are flight risks during transition
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Tenure (newer engineers more likely to leave)
  - Performance rating (high performers have external options)
  - Career dissatisfaction signals (manager input, engagement surveys)
  - External market signals (LinkedIn activity, referral patterns)
- **Output**: Risk scores for all 800 engineers; Cohort 4 (40 high-risk/high-value) identified for targeted retention

### Deliverables
1. **Engineer Profile Database** (800 engineers × 15+ attributes)
2. **Cohort Assignments** (C1-C4 allocation with confidence scores)
3. **Retention Risk Heat Map** (by team, by individual)
4. **Manager Calibration Notes** (strengths, gaps, training needs)

### Success Criteria
- 100% of engineers profiled by Jan 31
- Cohort assignments validated by managers (90%+ agreement)
- Risk map identifies 40 Cohort 4 engineers with high confidence

## Phase 2: New Org Design (Weeks 3-4)

### Objective
Design the new 2-tier IC + 3-tier leadership structure with transparent roles, promotion criteria, compensation bands, and career paths.

### Activities

#### 2.1 Org Structure Design (Owner: VP Ops Engineering)
- **Target**: 500 roles × 10 reporting lines (vs. current 800 × 30)
- **Structure**:
  ```
  Director (2) → Ops Lead (15) → Process Manager (25)
                                 → Ops Architect (50)
                                    → Senior Ops Engineer (180)
                                       → Ops Engineer (250)
  ```
- **Key Principles**:
  - More autonomous teams (less task assignment, more decision authority)
  - Flatter reporting (reduce middle layer)
  - Clear IC vs. leadership tracks
  - Manager span of control: 15-20 direct reports (up from ~10 currently)

#### 2.2 Role Descriptions (Owner: HR + Ops Leadership)
- **Scope**: Create detailed job descriptions for 6 IC roles + 3 leadership roles
- **Each Role Description Includes**:
  - Primary responsibilities (5-7 bullet points)
  - Decision authority (what they decide autonomously)
  - Career advancement criteria (what's required to reach next level)
  - Key performance indicators (how success is measured)
  - Compensation band (salary, bonus structure)
  - Typical reporting line and team size

#### 2.3 Authority Model Documentation (Owner: VP Ops)
- **Scope**: Define how decisions are made in new org (autonomy boundaries)
- **Key Decisions**:
  - **Process Design** (Senior Ops Engineer + Architect design, autonomously within policy)
  - **Process Execution** (Ops Engineer executes autonomously within approved frameworks)
  - **Incident Response** (Pre-defined escalation rules, not manager gate)
  - **Career Development** (Manager owns, with Architect input)
  - **Tool Selection** (Senior Engineer proposes, Architect approves)
- **Output**: Decision authority matrix (RACI-style, clear ownership)

#### 2.4 Manager Role Redefinition (Owner: HR + VP Ops)
- **Critical Transformation**: FROM task assignment → TO process architecture & people development
- **New Manager Responsibilities**:
  - Career Development (40% of time): Quarterly conversations, promotion pipeline, skill growth
  - Team Operations Support (30%): Enable engineers to execute processes, remove blockers
  - Team Health & Culture (20%): Retention, psychological safety, recognition, cohesion
  - Hiring & Performance (10%): Recruitment, onboarding, performance calibration
- **Key Shift**: Managers are "career architects" not "task dispatchers"

### Deliverables
1. **New Org Chart** (500 roles, clear reporting lines, 10 reporting units)
2. **Role Definitions** (detailed for each of 9 role types)
3. **Authority Model Documentation** (decision matrix, escalation rules)
4. **Manager Role Framework** (new responsibilities, time allocation, success metrics)

### Success Criteria
- Org chart approved by COO by Feb 14
- Role descriptions clear enough that engineers understand their career progression
- Authority model removes ambiguity about who decides what

- **Create case studies** of typical career paths (anonymized examples):
  - "From IC1 to IC3 in 24 months: Technical excellence + mentoring"
  - "From Senior Engineer to Manager: People developer ready for leadership"
  - "From IC4 to Architect: System-wide impact and technical vision"
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate paths are realistic, achievable, and valued

### Deliverables
1. **Compensation Band Framework** (6 IC bands + 2 leadership bands)
2. **Promotion Criteria Rubrics** (measurable, achievable standards)
3. **Career Path Flowchart** (visual representation of progression)
4. **Success Story Case Studies** (5-10 examples, anonymized)
