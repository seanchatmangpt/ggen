## Key Design Outcomes

### Organizational Transformation

**From**: 800 ops engineers, 30 reporting lines, task-assignment model
**To**: 500 ops engineers, 10 reporting lines, process-architecture model

**Headcount Reduction Method**: 
- Attrition (60% = 180 people)
- Non-renewal of contractors (30% = 90 people)
- Early retirement packages (10% = 30 people)
- No involuntary layoffs

**Justification**: 50% productivity gains through:
- Standardized processes (20% time savings)
- Automation and tooling (15% time savings)
- Reduced manager overhead from autonomy (10% time savings)
- Knowledge consolidation (5% time savings)

### Manager Role Transformation

**From**: Task assignment (50%), execution oversight (30%), escalation (20%)
**To**: Career development (40%), operations support (30%), team health (20%), hiring (10%)

**Key Shift**: Managers become "career architects" enabling autonomy, not "task dispatchers" assigning work

### Career Path Clarity

**Three Transparent Tracks**:
1. **Individual Contributor**: IC1 → IC2 → IC3 → IC4 → IC5 → IC6
2. **People Leadership**: Manager → Ops Lead → Director
3. **Technical Strategy**: Senior Engineer → Ops Architect → Principal

**Promotion Criteria**: Clear, measurable, achievable (50% of IC1 → IC3 in 24 months targeted)

### Compensation Alignment

- IC1-IC2: 10-12% increase (reward autonomy expansion)
- IC3-IC4: 15-18% increase (technical leadership expansion)
- IC5-IC6: 15-20% increase (strategic scope)
- Manager roles: Competitive with IC path (equity message)
- **Justified by**: Productivity gains (50%) absorb comp increases

### Retention Strategy (Critical Success Factor)

**Target**: <5% attrition spike (vs. 15%+ risk without strategy)

**Four Cohorts, Different Strategies**:
- **Cohort 1** (80 high performers): Fast-track promotions, exec mentoring, autonomy, strategic projects → 98%+ retention
- **Cohort 2** (150 stable): Comp increase, autonomy, career stability message, development → 95%+ retention
- **Cohort 3** (30 baseline attrition): Don't invest heavily, graceful exit path → 96% retention
- **Cohort 4** (40 flight risk): Intensive campaign (pre-announcement conversations, exec sponsors, retention bonuses if needed) → 90%+ retention

**Retention Levers**:
1. Clear career paths (transparent, achievable progression)
2. Competitive compensation (10-20% increases justified)
3. Autonomy and decision authority (less micromanagement)
4. Strategic mentoring (career development focus)
5. Early wins/visible proof (first promotions Week 10)
6. Risk mitigation for those not advancing (lateral moves, reskilling)

### Success Metrics & Gates

**Primary Metrics**:
- Attrition spike: <5% (vs. 8% baseline) ✓ Bi-weekly tracking
- Manager satisfaction: >70% ✓ Week 5, Week 12 surveys
- Career path clarity: >75% see clear path ✓ Week 6, Week 12 surveys
- Ops success rate: >98% maintained ✓ Continuous monitoring
- Role assignments: 100% by Week 6 ✓ Weekly tracking

**Phase Gates** (Andon stops):
1. Week 5: Manager Alignment (training, satisfaction >70%)
2. Week 6: Communication Complete (all-hands, 100% 1-on-1s)
3. Week 10: Transition Stable (first promotions, ops >98%, attrition <3%)
4. Week 16: Validation Passed (4 weeks operational stability)

### Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Discovery & Analysis
- **Weeks 3-4**: New Org Design
- **Week 5**: Manager Alignment & Training
- **Week 6**: Organization-Wide Communication
- **Weeks 7-10**: Role Transitions & Stabilization

## Critical Success Factors (Must-Haves)

2. ✅ **Retention Control**: <5% attrition spike, Cohort 4 stays >90%, zero top-performer resignations
3. ✅ **Operational Continuity**: Ops >98% maintained, no customer-facing impact
4. ✅ **Early Wins** (Week 10): 10 promotions announced publicly, credibility for career paths
5. ✅ **Role Clarity** (Week 7): All engineers understand new role, decision authority, reporting

## Risk Summary

**3 Major Risks Identified with Prevention & Remediation**:

1. **Manager Resistance** (HIGH)
   - Prevention: Intensive training, executive sponsorship, peer influence
   - Remedy: 1-on-1 coaching, role clarity sessions

2. **Attrition Spike** (HIGH)
   - Prevention: Early retention conversations, comp increases, career paths, success stories
   - Remedy: Retention bonuses, accelerated promotions, executive outreach

3. **Operational Degradation** (MEDIUM)
   - Prevention: Process frameworks, clear escalation rules, daily monitoring
   - Remedy: Process refinement, manager coaching

**All risks have detailed mitigation controls** in the RDF specifications and execution documents.
