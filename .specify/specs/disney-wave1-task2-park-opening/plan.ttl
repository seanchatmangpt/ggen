# ============================================================================

:DesignDecision_SequentialGates a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Sequential Gate Model (Not Parallel)" ;
    rdfs:comment "Six gates must pass in order: Security → Staffing → Equipment → Safety → Systems → Executive. No skipping." ;
    process:status "Approved by Operations" ;
    process:rationale "Security sweep must complete before staffing deployment (safety). Equipment checks require security clearance. Systems depend on equipment verification. Executive decision depends on all prior gates. This models real operational risk cascading." ;
    process:consequence "Critical path is 210 minutes; cannot compress if any gate fails. Parallel phases (security + staffing) provide some time savings (parallel timing = 90 min security + 90 min staffing vs. 180 min sequential)." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Fully parallel gates (all 6 in parallel) - REJECTED: Would require security sweep to happen while staff roaming park (safety violation)" ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Collapsing gates (e.g., combine equipment + safety) - REJECTED: Safety certification and equipment functionality are distinct concerns; require different expertise" ;
    process:owner "Director of Park Operations" .

:DesignDecision_SystemIntegrationPatterns a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Read-Only Integration with Manual Fallbacks" ;
    rdfs:comment "All integrations (Workday, SAP, Slack, systems) are read-only or event-driven. No automated system writes to process control state." ;
    process:status "Approved by CISO, CTO" ;
    process:rationale "Theme parks must never rely on external system availability for critical safety decisions. Every integration has a documented manual workaround (phone-based staffing confirmation, hand-written tickets, manual ride inspection)." ;
    process:consequence "More human involvement than ideal, but ensures park can open even if all systems are down. Slower for optimistic case, but deterministic and safe for failure cases." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Automated remediation (system X fails, automatically invoke procedure Y) - REJECTED: Introduces automation risk; humans must remain in control of safety-critical decisions" ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Tightly coupled integrations (Workday blocks gate 2 if API fails) - REJECTED: Creates hard dependency; would halt entire opening process" ;
    process:owner "Chief Information Officer" .

:DesignDecision_AuditTrailViaSlack a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Slack #incident-ops as Immutable Audit Trail" ;
    rdfs:comment "Every decision, gate passage, escalation, and exception logged to Slack #incident-ops. Slack becomes source of truth for what happened and when." ;
    process:status "Approved by Compliance, Legal" ;
    process:rationale "Slack provides: (1) timestamped log, (2) audit trail searchability, (3) real-time visibility for stakeholders, (4) integration with external compliance systems (Workday, SAP can read Slack for cross-verification), (5) low latency (immediate log entry vs. batch DB writes)" ;
    process:consequence "Slack outage is critical (no audit logging possible). All sensitive decisions require manual log backup (paper handoff sheet). Not HIPAA-compliant for medical parks (requires different audit system)." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Enterprise audit database (SAP audit trail) - REJECTED: Would require deep SAP integration; risky dependency; slower to query" ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Custom logging service - REJECTED: Adds complexity; Slack already used operationally; simpler to enhance than new system" ;
    process:owner "Director of Compliance" .

:DesignDecision_PhaseParallelism a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Parallel Execution of Security + Staffing Phases" ;
    rdfs:comment "Phase 1 (Security Sweep, 90 min) and Phase 2 (Staffing Verification, 90 min) run in parallel starting at 06:00 AM. Both can complete by 07:30 AM instead of 180 min if sequential." ;
    process:status "Approved by Ops" ;
    process:rationale "Security sweep covers perimeter (gates, cameras, patrol) with no staff involved. Staffing occurs in secure facility. No data dependency between phases. Parallel execution saves 90 minutes on critical path." ;
    process:consequence "Requires two independent teams (security + staffing) to execute simultaneously. Scheduling must account for this. If either phase blocked, process still continues with other." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Sequential phases (security first, then staffing) - Would add 90 min to total duration (300 min vs. 210 min); risk of late opening" ;
    process:owner "Director of Park Operations" .

:DesignDecision_RiskAcceptance_ManualTicketing a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Accept Degraded Mode: Manual Ticketing If System Fails" ;
    rdfs:comment "If ticketing system unavailable at opening, gate 5 fails, but park can open in 'manual mode' with hand-written tickets and reconciliation after recovery." ;
    process:status "Approved by VP Operations, Finance" ;
    process:rationale "Ticketing system downtime on opening day is rare (<0.5% probability), but revenue impact ($200k+/hr) justifies accepting degraded mode. Manual ticketing process documented and trained quarterly. 50 ticket booths with manual stubs ensure capacity for manual processing." ;
    process:consequence "1-2 hour opening delay if ticketing requires manual recovery, but NOT a park closure. Revenue captured but reconciliation effort increases (~50 FTE hours). Customer experience degraded but manageable." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Park closure if ticketing unavailable - REJECTED: Unacceptable revenue/brand impact" ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Mandatory ticketing system redundancy (dual-site failover) - REJECTED: $5M capex for 0.5% downtime; ROI insufficient" ;
    process:owner "Vice President of Operations" .

:DesignDecision_WeatherDecisionPoint a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Weather Assessment in Phase 5 (Final Decision)" ;
    rdfs:comment "Weather check (NOAA feed, lightning risk, severe storm) occurs in executive review phase (08:55 AM), not earlier. Can still delay opening at last minute." ;
    process:status "Approved by VP Operations" ;
    process:rationale "Weather patterns can change rapidly; 4-hour advance forecast unreliable. Checking at last moment (5-min buffer) provides most accurate risk assessment. If weather deteriorates, opening can be delayed without losing prep work." ;
    process:consequence "Potential last-minute announcement to guests (ride closures, 30-min delay). Guest services team pre-positioned to handle announcements. Delay cost (~$50k per 30 min) acceptable to avoid operating in unsafe weather." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Early weather cutoff (06:00 AM) - REJECTED: Would make 90 min of prep work redundant if weather worsens; inefficient" ;
    process:owner "Chief Operating Officer" .

:DesignDecision_CalloutDrill_Automatic a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Automated Callout Drill Invocation (Conditional)" ;
    rdfs:comment "If critical positions unfilled after Workday pull, automatically invoke callout system. No manual decision required; triggered by HR system." ;
    process:status "Approved by HR, Ops" ;
    process:rationale "Staffing gaps often detected early (05:00 AM). Automated callout system can reach on-call staff within 15 min. Faster response than manual coordination. Reduces 'hunting' for backup staff." ;
    process:consequence "False positives possible (pulled schedule shows vacancy, but person called in overnight). Callout system configured to not double-call. HR must manage on-call roster carefully." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Manual callout (HR coord decides) - REJECTED: Introduces decision latency; gaps go unfilled if HR slow to respond" ;
    process:owner "Director of Human Resources" .

:DesignDecision_ContinuousBadgeScanMonitoring a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Continuous Badge Scan Monitoring (Not Point-in-Time)" ;
    rdfs:comment "Phase 2 staffing verification runs continuously (06:30-08:00 AM), not as a single checkpoint. New arrivals scanned after initial pull." ;
    process:status "Approved by Security, Ops" ;
    process:rationale "Staff arrive staggered over 90 minutes. Continuous monitoring ensures late arrivals (delayed by traffic, etc.) still counted. Point-in-time check (e.g., 07:00 AM only) would miss late-arrivals counted in actual daily roster." ;
    process:consequence "Security officer must monitor badge system continuously; cannot step away. Requires second security staff member or shift coverage." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Single checkpoint at 07:00 AM - REJECTED: Would fail to count 15-20% of expected staff who arrive 07:15-08:00 AM" ;
    process:owner "Director of Security" .

:DesignDecision_RideTestsNightBefore a process:DesignDecision ;
    rdfs:label "Pre-Run Ride Tests Night Before (Optimization)" ;
    rdfs:comment "Maintenance team runs automated ride tests at 22:00 (closing day), not at opening. Opening day tests are verification only." ;
    process:status "Approved by Maintenance" ;
    process:rationale "Most ride issues surface during night tests. Issues flagged allow 7+ hours for repair before opening. Morning tests become fast confirmation (10 min vs. 30 min if running first time). Reduces critical path by 20 minutes." ;
    process:consequence "Requires night team to run tests; adds 30 min to closing procedures. Risk: overnight maintenance could introduce new faults (software update, part replacement). Mitigated by requiring test re-run if any maintenance performed after 22:00." ;
    process:alternativeConsidered "Single test at opening (current practice) - REJECTED: Takes 30 min; if failure found, repair eats into opening window; rework expensive under time pressure" ;
