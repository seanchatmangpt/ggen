FOLK TERMINOLOGY MAPPING
================================================================================

"It took off!"                   → T3 (Formation→Growth)
"Lost product-market fit"        → T4 (Growth→Formation)
"Market disappeared"             → T6 or T8 (existential collapse)
"We got disrupted"               → T4, T5, or T6 (ambiguous; requires metrics)
"It's a commodity now"           → T5 (Growth→Commodity)
"Wrong customer"                 → T2 (Formation→Vacuum)
"We disrupted ourselves"         → T7 (Commodity→Formation)
"Local maximum"                  → Stuck in Formation (profitable niche, can't scale)

MEASURABLE METRICS REFERENCE
================================================================================

Growth-Commodity Boundary (T5):
  marketGrowthRateYoY < 0.2          (market growing <20% per year)
  featureParity >= 0.8               (80%+ features match competitors)
  topCompetitorsMarketShare > 0.6    (3-4 players control market)
  CAC YoY growth > 0.1               (customer acquisition cost rising)
  LTV trend = declining              (customer lifetime value down)
  grossMargin < 0.65                 (margin compression from price wars)

Formation-Growth Boundary (T3) - PMF Signals:
  LTV / CAC >= 3                     (customer value 3x+ cost to acquire)
  NPS > 30                           (Net Promoter Score >30 = healthy)
  monthlyGrowthRate >= 0.2           (20% MoM for 2+ consecutive months)
  topSegmentConcentration >= 0.8     (80%+ revenue from 1-2 customer types)
  ARR >= $50k                        (demonstrates sustainability)
  salesCyclePredictability >= 0.85   (can forecast sales)

Lost PMF Signals (T4):
  CAC rising > 0.2 YoY               (customer acquisition getting expensive)
  LTV declining                      (new cohorts worth less)
  monthlyGrowthRate < 0.2            (growth slowed from >20%)
  churnRate increasing               (customers leaving more)
  newCohortRetention < priorCohort   (newer customers stickier)
  LTV / CAC < 2.5                    (eroded from ≥3)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

1. SPECIFICATION-DRIVEN
   - RDF TTL is source of truth
   - All transitions measurable and quantified
   - No subjective or hand-wavy definitions

2. FOLK GROUNDED
   - Founder language mapped to formal state-transition language
   - Disambiguates fuzzy terms ("disrupted", "growth")
   - Bridges informal strategy ↔ formal analysis

3. ACTIONABLE
   - Clear crossing criteria for each transition
   - Observable signals during transitions
   - Recovery strategies for regressions

4. QUERYABLE
   - Full SPARQL support for analysis
   - Semantic web integration
   - Enables automated state diagnosis

5. REALISTIC
   - Duration estimates based on market practice
   - Failure modes reflect actual company failures
   - Folk terminology authentic to startup discourse

USAGE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

DIAGNOSE STATE:
  Given: LTV/CAC=4.2, NPS=42, MoM_growth=25%
  Result: GROWTH state (T3 crossed from Formation)

PREDICT TRANSITION RISK:
  Given: CAC rising 20% YoY, LTV declining, MoM_growth=5%
  Risk: T4 (Lost PMF) - approaching regression to Formation

INTERPRET FOUNDER LANGUAGE:
  Founder: "It took off!"
  Formal: T3 crossing confirmed (Formation→Growth)
  Action: Monitor metrics; plan scaling; watch for T4 risks

RECOVERY PLANNING (Lost PMF):
  State: Growth, T4 regression in progress
  Actions:
    1. Identify high-LTV customer cohorts (segment analysis)
    2. Focus marketing on those segments only
    3. Product iteration to address churn causes in weak cohorts
    4. Decision: Fix PMF (rejoin Growth) or admit wrong market

INNOVATION ESCAPE:
  State: Commodity (mature, low growth)
  Strategy: T7 (Innovation jump)
  Requirements:
    - New product in adjacent market (different customer segment)
    - Separate P&L (don't cannibalize legacy product)
    - Patient capital (18-24 months to Formation maturity in new market)
    - Leadership autonomy (startup principles, not corporate governance)
