# PROC-MACRO DUPLICATION ANALYSIS (Updated 2026-01-24)
# ===================================================================
# After updating genai to 0.5 and centralizing in workspace.dependencies:
#
# derive_more duplicates (3 versions):
#   - v2.1.1: genai (production) - unavoidable, genai's choice
#   - v1.0.0: value-ext ← genai (production, transitive) - unavoidable
#   - v0.99.20: cucumber (dev-only) - ACCEPTABLE
#
# darling duplicates (2 versions):
#   - v0.21.3: serde_with_macros ← genai (production, transitive)
#   - v0.20.11: dummy ← fake ← chicago-tdd-tools (dev-only) - ACCEPTABLE
#
# Impact: 2 production proc-macro duplicates from genai's inconsistent dep tree
# These are unavoidable without forking genai or value-ext.
# Dev-only duplicates (cucumber, chicago-tdd-tools) are acceptable.
