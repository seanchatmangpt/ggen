**Generated**: {{ now() | date(format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") }}

## Pre-Deployment Validation

- [ ] All containers have health checks configured
- [ ] All communication paths are documented
- [ ] All data stores are properly configured
- [ ] Security groups allow required traffic
- [ ] TLS certificates are valid
- [ ] Database backups are tested

## Container Deployment Checklist

{% for container in containers | sort(attribute="container_name") %}
### {{ container.container_name }}

**SLA**: {{ container.sla_response_time }}ms response, {{ container.sla_availability }}% availability

- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Image passes security scanning
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Memory limits: {{ container.memory_limit | default(value="512Mi") }}
- [ ] CPU limits: {{ container.cpu_limit | default(value="500m") }}
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Database migrations complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Cache is warm
- [ ] Logs are being collected
- [ ] Metrics are being exported
- [ ] Traces are being recorded
- [ ] Service is registered in service mesh
- [ ] Canary deployment (5% traffic)
- [ ] Monitor error rates for 5 minutes
- [ ] If errors < 1%, proceed to 50% traffic
- [ ] If errors < 1%, proceed to 100% traffic
- [ ] If errors > 1%, rollback immediately
