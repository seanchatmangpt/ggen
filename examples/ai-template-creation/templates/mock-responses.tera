# Mock Responses

Mock mode provides pre-generated responses for common prompts. Use for testing and learning without API costs.

## Enable Mock Mode

```bash
ggen ai generate --mock "Your prompt here"
```

Or globally:

```bash
export GGEN_MOCK_AI=true
ggen ai generate "Any prompt"
```

## Available Mock Templates

When using mock mode, ggen returns realistic examples for:

- **Structs**: Fully implemented with derives and methods
- **Endpoints**: Complete async handlers with error handling
- **Validation**: Schemas and validation logic
- **Tests**: Working unit and integration tests

## Benefits of Mock Mode

- **No API Keys**: Works offline, no credentials needed
- **Instant**: Returns immediately without network delay
- **Reproducible**: Same input always produces same output
- **Testing**: Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
- **Learning**: Understand patterns without costs

## When to Use Real AI

Switch to real AI when:
- You need novel or custom patterns
- You're building production templates
- You want optimization suggestions
- You need iterative refinement

See configuration docs for setting API keys.
