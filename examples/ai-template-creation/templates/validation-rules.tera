# Template Validation Rules

ggen ai validate checks AI-generated templates against these quality criteria.

## Syntax Rules

**Rust Syntax**: Template must compile with rustc
- [ ] Code follows Rust style guidelines
- [ ] All types are properly namespaced
- [ ] Imports are included
- [ ] No undefined variables

**Template Syntax**: Valid YAML frontmatter and Tera
- [ ] Frontmatter between --- markers
- [ ] Valid YAML in frontmatter
- [ ] Proper Tera syntax ({{ }}, {% %})
- [ ] Filters are valid

## Safety Rules

**No Unsafe Blocks** (production code)
- [ ] No unsafe {} blocks in main code
- [ ] Unsafe only in well-documented sections
- [ ] Alternative safe approaches documented

**Error Handling**
- [ ] All fallible operations use Result<T, E>
- [ ] No unwrap() in production code
- [ ] Errors properly propagated

## Quality Rules

**Documentation**
- [ ] Public items have doc comments
- [ ] Examples in documentation
- [ ] Edge cases explained

**Testing**
- [ ] Unit tests included
- [ ] Tests are meaningful
- [ ] Coverage > 80%

## Run Validation

```bash
ggen ai validate templates/user.tera
ggen ai validate --verbose templates/user.tera
```

## Fix Common Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Unknown filter | Use only Tera built-in filters |
| Invalid YAML | Check frontmatter syntax |
| Undefined types | Add missing imports |
| Unsafe blocks | Replace with safe alternatives |
