# YAML Frontmatter Examples

## Basic Example

```yaml
---
to: "generated/{{ name | snake_case }}.rs"
vars:
  name: string
  description: string
---
```

## Complex Example

```yaml
---
to: "generated/{{ name | snake_case }}.rs"
vars:
  name: string
  description: string
  has_id: boolean
  fields: array
  validation_rules: object
---
```

## Output Path Patterns

```yaml
# Simple file
to: "output.rs"

# With variable substitution
to: "generated/{{ name }}.rs"

# With filters
to: "src/{{ module | snake_case }}/mod.rs"

# With nested paths
to: "src/generated/{{ category }}/{{ name | snake_case }}.rs"
```
