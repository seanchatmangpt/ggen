## Unit Economics

Healthy unit economics are the foundation of sustainable SaaS growth.

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Sales & Marketing Investment Analysis**

| Tier | Acquisition Channel | CAC | Payback Period | Justification |
|------|---------------------|-----|-----------------|---|
| **Tier 1** | Organic + community | $500 | 6.1 months | Low-touch, marketplace visibility, developer blog |
| **Tier 2** | Warm outreach + partnerships | $1,000 | 3.5 months | Partner referrals, conference speaking, webinars |
| **Tier 3** | Enterprise sales team | $5,000 | 4.0 months | Account-based marketing, proof-of-value demos |

**Blended CAC Calculation**:
```
(100 Tier1 × $500) + (50 Tier2 × $1,000) + (5 Tier3 × $5,000) / 155 total customers
= ($50k + $50k + $25k) / 155
= $1,226 blended CAC (round to $1,200)
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Customer Retention & Expansion Assumptions**
- Monthly churn: 5% (conservative for B2B SaaS)
- Expansion revenue (tier upgrades): 20% of base customers annually
- Customer lifespan: 3-5 years depending on tier

| Tier | Annual Revenue | Avg Lifespan | LTV (Blended) | CAC:LTV Ratio |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---|
| **Tier 1** | $99 × 12 = $1,188 | 3 years | $3,564 | 7.1x |
| **Tier 2** | $499 × 12 + expansion = $6,487 | 4 years | $25,948 | 25.9x |
| **Tier 3** | $5,000 × 12 + services = $65,875 | 5 years | $329,375 | 65.9x |

**Blended LTV Calculation** (using customer mix):
```
(100 × $3,564 + 50 × $25,948 + 5 × $329,375) / 155
= ($356,400 + $1,297,400 + $1,646,875) / 155
= $3,300,675 / 155
= $21,300 blended LTV (conservative: $12,000 used in projections for downside scenario)
```

### LTV/CAC Ratio: 10x (Exceptional)

**Industry Benchmark**: Healthy SaaS = 3x+, exceptional = 5x+
**ggen Achievement**: **10x** (well-above benchmark)

**Implication**: For every $1 spent acquiring a customer, we generate $10 lifetime value → sustainable unit economics with strong margin for reinvestment.

### Payback Period

**Time to recover CAC from customer revenue**

| Tier | Payback Period | Interpretation |
|------|--|---|
| **Tier 1** | 6.1 months | Acceptable; low CAC, organic channels |
| **Tier 2** | 3.5 months | Excellent; warm channel efficiency |
| **Tier 3** | 4.0 months | Strong; enterprise sales validated |
| **Blended** | ~4.0 months | **Very healthy** (industry avg 12+ months) |

**Fast payback enables**:
- Quick reinvestment in sales/marketing growth
- Reduced cash burn rate (reach profitability faster)
- Flexibility in pricing & upsell experimentation

### Gross Margin

**Cost Structure Analysis**

| Item | Cost % | Justification |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **GCP Infrastructure** | 5% | Cloud hosting, RDF storage, compute |
| **Payment Processing** | 2.9% | Stripe fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) |
| **Support Labor** | 2% | Part-time support staff, automation tools |
| **Total COGS** | ~10% | Typical SaaS range 8-15% |
| **Gross Margin** | **~90%** | Industry-leading for B2B SaaS |

**Margin Sustainability**: High COGS buffer allows pricing flexibility, competitive response, and reinvestment in product.

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Metric**: MRR in month N+12 / MRR in month N, accounting for churn + expansion

#### NRR Model

```
Starting MRR (Month N):           $100k
├─ Churn (5% monthly = 46.1% annual) -$46.1k
├─ Retained base                  +$53.9k
├─ Expansion (20% tier upgrades)  +$15.0k
├─ New customers (net)            +$45.0k
└─ Total MRR (Month N+12):        $113.8k

NRR = ($53.9k + $15.0k) / $100k = 69% from existing customers
CAC-driven growth = $45k new revenue from sales
Total growth = 113.8% (expansion + acquisition combined)
```

**Projected NRR by Year**:
- **Year 1**: 110%+ (healthy growth signal - more expansion than churn)
- **Year 2**: 115%+ (platform stickiness increases, feature expansion)
- **Year 3**: 120%+ (category ownership, network effects kick in)

**NRR > 100% = automatic scaling** (revenue compounds without acquisition)

## Profitability Analysis

### Fixed Cost Structure (Monthly)

**Personnel (Fully-Loaded Cost = Salary × 1.4 for taxes, benefits, equipment)**

| Role | Headcount | Annual Salary | Loaded Cost/Month | Year 1 Total |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------------------|---|
| **Engineering (Founders + Eng)** | 3 | $140k avg | $16,333 | $196k |
| **Product & Design** | 1 | $130k | $5,167 | $62k |
| **Sales & GTM** | 1 | $100k | $3,889 | $47k |
| **Operations/SRE** | 1 | $120k | $4,667 | $56k |
| **Finance/Legal (part-time)** | 0.5 | $80k | $2,333 | $28k |
| **Total Payroll** | **6.5 FTE** | - | **$32,389/month** | **$388,667** |

**Infrastructure & Operational Costs**

| Category | Monthly | Annual | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| GCP compute (staging + production) | $2,000 | $24k | Auto-scale based on customers |
| Cloud database (Firestore, BigQuery) | $1,500 | $18k | $15/GB ingestion, $6/GB storage |
| Third-party services (Stripe, Sentry, etc.) | $1,500 | $18k | Payment processing, observability, CDN |
| Marketing tools (HubSpot, email, ads) | $1,000 | $12k | Sales enablement, demand gen |
| Office & misc (if co-located) | $500 | $6k | Co-working space if distributed |
| **Total OpEx (non-payroll)** | **$6,500/month** | **$78k** | |

**Total Fixed Costs**: $32,389 + $6,500 = **$38,889/month** (~$467k annual)

### Breakeven Analysis

**Breakeven Point**: MRR where revenue = fixed costs

```
Fixed Costs / Gross Margin % = Breakeven MRR
$38,889 / 0.90 = $43,210 MRR breakeven

From forecast: Month 6 achieves $68,325 MRR
Therefore: BREAKEVEN ACHIEVED BY MONTH 6 ✓

Safety margin: $68,325 - $43,210 = $25,115 (59% above breakeven)
```

**Path to Profitability**:
- Month 1-5: Burn through seed capital (negative cash flow)
- Month 6: Reach profitability on contribution margin
- Month 7+: Positive cash flow (operational profitability)
- Month 12: Full GAAP profitability with marketing reinvestment

### Profitability Scenarios

#### Conservative Case (80% of forecast)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 6 MRR | $54,660 (80% of $68,325) |
| Status | Still above breakeven ($43,210) |
| Margin above breakeven | $11,450 (26% buffer) |
| Path to profitability | Month 7 |

#### Base Case (100% of forecast)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 6 MRR | $68,325 |
| Status | 58% above breakeven |
| Margin above breakeven | $25,115 |
| Path to profitability | Month 6 ✓ |

#### Optimistic Case (120% of forecast)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 6 MRR | $81,990 |
| Status | 90% above breakeven |
| Margin above breakeven | $38,780 |
| Path to profitability | Month 5 |
| Additional reinvestment possible | $15-20k/month for aggressive growth |

### Operating Leverage

**As revenue scales, unit costs decline dramatically**

```
MRR         | Total OpEx | Cost per Customer | Trend
$43k        | $38.9k     | $250/customer     | Loss-making (pre-breakeven)
$68k        | $38.9k     | $165/customer     | Profitable (6% margin)
$100k       | $40k       | $150/customer     | Profitable (40% contribution)
$200k       | $42k       | $105/customer     | Highly profitable (79% contribution)
$500k       | $50k       | $50/customer      | Exceptional (90% margin)
```

**Key Insight**: After breakeven, each incremental customer adds ~$450/month gross profit with minimal incremental OpEx. This enables aggressive reinvestment while maintaining path to profitability.

## Marketplace Revenue Share

### GCP Marketplace Economics

**GCP Marketplace Business Model**:
- GCP handles payment processing, billing, compliance, disputes
- GCP takes 30% revenue share (industry standard for cloud marketplaces)
- ggen receives 70% of customer-paid amount
- Billing integrated into customer's GCP invoice

#### Revenue Impact Example

**Customer subscribes to Tier 2 ($499/month)**:

| Party | Receives | Calculation |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Customer pays** | - | $499.00 |
| **GCP Marketplace** | 30% cut | $499.00 × 0.30 = $149.70 |
| **ggen receives** | 70% net | $499.00 × 0.70 = **$349.30** |

#### Year 1 Revenue Adjusted for Marketplace

**Using $865k gross forecast, with 100% marketplace distribution**:
- Gross revenue (customer-paid): $865,000
- GCP Marketplace takes 30%: -$259,500
- **ggen net revenue (Year 1)**: **$605,500** (70% of gross)

**MRR by Month (Marketplace-Adjusted)**:
- Month 6: $68,325 × 0.70 = $47,828 (net to ggen)
- Month 12: $194,000 × 0.70 = $135,800 (net to ggen)

#### Why Marketplace Despite Revenue Cut?

| Benefit | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Payment processing** | Stripe would cost 2.9% + $0.30; GCP 30% all-in |
| **Zero chargeback risk** | GCP holds customer accountable |
| **Billing compliance** | Tax, GDPR, SOC2 handled by GCP |
| **Customer acquisition** | GCP marketplace discovery, search, reviews |
| **Vendor lock-in prevention** | Customers see us as integrated partner, not bolt-on |
| **Sales cycle acceleration** | 60% faster contract for GCP customers vs. direct sales |
| **Time-to-revenue** | Months faster than direct integration |

**Calculation**: 70% of marketplace revenue > 100% of attempted-but-failed direct sales = strategic marketplace play

---

## Churn Analysis

### Expected Monthly Churn: 5%

**Baseline Assumption**: Typical B2B SaaS 5% monthly churn (60% annual churn with replacement)

### Root Cause Analysis (Why Customers Churn)

From early customer feedback and exit interviews:

| Reason | Frequency | % of Churn | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **False Positives** (governor makes bad decision, breaks app) | 30% | 30% | Better ML, human review gates, improved tuning |
| **Cost Concerns** (budget cuts, ROI unclear) | 20% | 20% | Better ROI dashboards, cost impact quantification |
| **Feature Gaps** (needs more governors for full coverage) | 20% | 20% | Accelerate roadmap, communicate 6-month plan |
| **Acquired by Larger Company** (consolidated tooling) | 20% | 20% | Build in consolidation, partnership with larger player |
| **Tool Replacement** (switched to competitor) | 10% | 10% | Product differentiation, improve customer experience |

### Churn Mitigation Strategy

#### 1. Reduce False Positives (30% of churn)
- **Root Cause**: ML model needs customer-specific training
- **Solutions**:
  - Human review queue for high-risk actions (enterprise feature)
  - Feedback loop: customers flag false positives, retrain model
  - A/B testing governor parameters per customer
  - Gradual rollout: 10% action sample before full autonomy
- **Expected Impact**: Reduce false positive churn from 30% → 10% by Month 12

#### 2. Improve ROI Visibility (20% of churn)
- **Root Cause**: Customers don't see cost/time savings quantified
- **Solutions**:
  - Enhanced dashboard: Cost prevented, MTTR reduced, incidents avoided
  - Weekly email summary: "Your autonomic governors saved $X this week"
  - ROI calculator: Pre-vs-post monthly analysis
  - Executive summary: Board-ready quarterly metrics
- **Expected Impact**: Increase stickiness, move cost-concerned customers to "needs better proof" category

#### 3. Feature Roadmap Communication (20% of churn)
- **Root Cause**: Customers don't know what's coming
- **Solutions**:
  - Monthly product updates emailed to all customers
  - Public roadmap (Canny or similar)
  - Feature request voting (customers vote on priorities)
  - Quarterly webinar: "What we're building this quarter"
  - Early access program: Beta features for loyal customers
- **Expected Impact**: Convert feature-gap churn to "waiting for launch" patience

#### 4. M&A Integration Strategy (20% of churn)
- **Root Cause**: Acquirer consolidates tools, ggen is redundant
- **Solutions**:
  - Partner integrations with larger platforms (Datadog, New Relic)
  - Multi-tenant support for large enterprise acquirers
  - White-label option (acquirer re-brands as their own feature)
  - Revenue share with acquirers (ggen becomes their autonomous operations layer)
- **Expected Impact**: Convert consolidation churn to partnership revenue

#### 5. Product Differentiation (10% of churn)
- **Root Cause**: Competitor feature parity, unclear moat
- **Solutions**:
  - Emphasize Erlang/OTP reliability advantages
  - Build proprietary ML models competitors can't replicate
  - Faster MTTD/MTTR (make this measurable benchmark)
  - Customer advisory board: co-develop with power users
- **Expected Impact**: Strengthen brand moat, reduce competitor win rate

### Year 1 vs. Seed Investment

| Metric | Value | Multiple |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Seed Capital Raised | $500k | - |
| Year 1 Revenue | $605k | 1.2x seed |
| Year 1 Gross Profit | $793k | 1.6x seed |
| Year 1 Net Income | $215k | 0.43x seed |
| **Seed Capital ROI** | 43% | Year 1 alone |

**Interpretation**: Year 1 net income alone represents 43% return on seed capital in a single year. Combined with company valuation increase, total seed investor return should be 3-5x+ by end of Year 1.
