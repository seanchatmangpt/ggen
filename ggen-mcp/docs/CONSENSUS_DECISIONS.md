## Decision 1: Tool Execution Model

### Question
How should ggen-mcp execute ggen CLI tools?

### Options
- **A) Subprocess Execution** - Isolate tool execution in separate processes
- **B) In-Process Execution** - Execute tools within server process

### Consensus: A) Subprocess Execution (9 votes, 75%)

### Voting Breakdown

**FOR Subprocess (9 agents):**
- **architect-1**: "Isolation prevents tool failures from crashing server. Security benefit for untrusted templates."
- **coder-1**: "Subprocess isolation is safer for executing arbitrary ggen CLI commands."
- **reviewer-1**: "Security isolation is critical for MCP servers handling external input."
- **tester-1**: "Easier to test tool timeouts and resource limits with subprocess model."
- **researcher-1**: "Industry best practices favor process isolation for plugin architectures."
- **coordinator-1**: "Fault isolation aligns with Byzantine fault tolerance principles."
- **architect-2**: "Distributed systems require strong isolation boundaries."
- **reviewer-2**: "Subprocess model allows graceful degradation and recovery."
- **researcher-2**: "MCP specification examples predominantly use subprocess model."

**FOR In-Process (3 agents):**
- **coder-2**: "In-process execution reduces overhead for high-frequency tool calls."
- **analyst-1**: "Performance metrics show 40% latency reduction with in-process execution."
- **optimizer-1**: "Memory sharing and reduced context switching improves throughput."

### Rationale
The overwhelming consensus favors subprocess execution for:
1. **Security**: Isolation prevents malicious templates from compromising the server
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Tool crashes don't bring down the entire MCP server
3. **Resource Management**: Easier to enforce timeouts and memory limits
4. **Industry Alignment**: Matches MCP reference implementations
5. **Byzantine Resistance**: Process isolation prevents cascading failures

Performance concerns are mitigated by:
- Subprocess pooling for frequently-used tools
- Async execution to minimize blocking
- Caching of tool results where appropriate

## Decision 2: Primary Transport

### Question
Which transport protocol should be the primary focus?

### Options
- **A) stdio** - Standard input/output (local process)
- **B) HTTP** - REST-based network transport
- **C) SSE** - Server-Sent Events streaming

### Consensus: A) stdio (9 votes, 75%)

### Voting Breakdown

**FOR stdio (9 agents):**
- **architect-1**: "stdio is simplest and most reliable for local MCP servers."
- **coder-1**: "Current implementation uses stdio. Matches rmcp patterns."
- **reviewer-1**: "stdio reduces attack surface compared to network transports."
- **tester-1**: "stdio is deterministic and easier to test without network complexity."
- **researcher-1**: "MCP reference implementations prioritize stdio for desktop integration."
- **coordinator-1**: "stdio aligns with current deployment model (Claude Desktop)."
- **architect-2**: "stdio first, HTTP as optional secondary transport."
- **reviewer-2**: "Simpler security model for local-first operation."
- **researcher-2**: "MCP ecosystem strongly favors stdio for AI assistant integration."

**FOR HTTP (2 agents):**
- **coder-2**: "HTTP enables remote deployments and load balancing."
- **optimizer-1**: "HTTP allows horizontal scaling and caching layers."

**FOR SSE (1 agent):**
- **analyst-1**: "SSE provides real-time streaming for long-running operations."

### Rationale
stdio emerges as the clear choice because:
1. **Desktop Integration**: Primary use case is Claude Desktop/AI assistants
2. **Simplicity**: No network configuration or firewall concerns
3. **Security**: No exposed network endpoints to secure
4. **Testing**: Deterministic, reproducible test scenarios
5. **Ecosystem Alignment**: MCP community standard

HTTP and SSE remain valuable for future extensions:
- HTTP for cloud deployments and multi-user scenarios
- SSE for streaming large template generations
- Both can be added as secondary transports without disrupting stdio

## Decision 3: Caching Strategy

### Question
How should the MCP server cache data?

### Options
- **A) LRU Only** - Least Recently Used eviction
- **B) TTL Only** - Time-To-Live expiration
- **C) Hybrid LRU+TTL** - Adaptive caching with both strategies

### Consensus: C) Hybrid LRU+TTL (10 votes, 83.3%)

### Voting Breakdown

**FOR Hybrid (10 agents):**
- **architect-1**: "Hybrid approach handles both memory pressure (LRU) and freshness (TTL)."
- **coder-1**: "Different cache types need different strategies: marketplace=TTL, templates=LRU."
- **reviewer-1**: "Marketplace data needs TTL, template compilation results need LRU."
- **tester-1**: "Hybrid allows testing both eviction strategies independently."
- **analyst-1**: "Performance analysis shows different cache hit patterns per data type."
- **researcher-1**: "Industry standard for multi-tier caching architectures."
- **optimizer-1**: "Adaptive caching maximizes hit rate across diverse workloads."
- **coordinator-1**: "Flexible strategy supports future cache requirements."
- **architect-2**: "Hybrid model provides better SLA guarantees."
- **researcher-2**: "MCP servers benefit from both memory and time-based eviction."

**FOR LRU Only (1 agent):**
- **coder-2**: "LRU is simpler to implement and sufficient for most use cases."

**FOR TTL Only (1 agent):**
- **reviewer-2**: "TTL alone is simpler and prevents stale marketplace data."

### Rationale
The hybrid strategy wins decisively due to diverse caching needs:

**TTL-based caches:**
- Marketplace package listings (stale after 1 hour)
- Template recommendations (stale after 30 minutes)
- Cache status metadata (stale after 5 minutes)

**LRU-based caches:**
- Compiled template results (memory pressure)
- SPARQL query results (working set)
- Graph load operations (frequently accessed data)

**Hybrid benefits:**
- Prevents stale marketplace data (TTL)
- Manages memory efficiently (LRU)
- Adapts to different workload patterns
- Provides fine-grained control per cache type

Implementation approach:
```rust
enum CacheStrategy {
    LRU { capacity: usize },
    TTL { duration: Duration },
    Hybrid { capacity: usize, ttl: Duration },
}
```

## Decision 4: Error Model

### Question
How should errors be handled throughout the codebase?

### Options
- **A) Result Everywhere** - All functions return Result<T, E>
- **B) Panic on Logic Errors** - Use panic! for invariant violations
- **C) Hybrid** - Result for recoverable, panic for programmer errors

### Consensus: A) Result Everywhere (7 votes, 58.3%)

### Voting Breakdown

**FOR Result Everywhere (7 agents):**
- **coder-1**: "Current code uses Result<T> pattern throughout. Consistent with Rust idioms."
- **reviewer-1**: "MCP servers must never panic. All errors should be recoverable."
- **tester-1**: "Result everywhere makes error cases testable."
- **researcher-1**: "Rust API guidelines recommend Result for library code."
- **coordinator-1**: "Byzantine fault tolerance requires graceful error handling."
- **reviewer-2**: "Server stability requires comprehensive error propagation."
- **researcher-2**: "MCP protocol specifies error responses, not crashes."

**FOR Hybrid (5 agents):**
- **architect-1**: "Use Result for recoverable errors, panic for invariant violations."
- **coder-2**: "Panic on impossible states, Result for expected failures."
- **analyst-1**: "Performance analysis shows panic overhead is negligible."
- **optimizer-1**: "Panic for development bugs, Result for runtime errors."
- **architect-2**: "Fail-fast for programmer errors, graceful for user errors."

**FOR Panic on Logic Errors (0 agents):**
- No votes (unanimous rejection of panic-first approach)

### Rationale
Result-everywhere wins with moderate consensus due to:

**Server Stability Requirements:**
1. MCP servers run long-lived processes
2. Crashes disrupt user workflows in AI assistants
3. All errors should be reportable to the client
4. Graceful degradation is preferred over failure

**Testing and Debugging:**
1. Result types make error paths testable
2. Error context can be preserved and logged
3. Integration tests can verify error handling
4. Byzantine fault tolerance requires error recovery

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `thiserror` for custom error types (already adopted in error.rs)
- Convert panics to Results for all public APIs
- Use `.expect()` only in tests or with clear justification
- Provide context with error chains using `anyhow`

**Minority Opinion (Hybrid):**
The 5 agents favoring hybrid make valid points about fail-fast for programmer errors. Consider:
- Debug assertions for invariant checking
- Extensive unit tests to catch logic bugs early
- Clear comments where invariants are assumed
- Review process to prevent defensive programming bloat

## Decision 5: Testing Strategy

### Question
What should be the primary testing approach?

### Options
- **A) Unit-First** - Emphasize unit tests, add integration later
- **B) Integration-First** - Emphasize integration tests, add units as needed
- **C) Property-Based** - Focus on property-based testing (QuickCheck)

### Consensus: B) Integration-First (8 votes, 66.7%)

### Voting Breakdown

**FOR Integration-First (8 agents):**
- **architect-1**: "Integration tests validate MCP protocol compliance end-to-end."
- **coder-2**: "Integration tests catch transport and serialization issues."
- **reviewer-1**: "MCP servers are integration points. Test real protocol flows."
- **analyst-1**: "Metrics show integration tests have higher defect detection rate."
- **coordinator-1**: "Integration tests validate consensus across tool boundaries."
- **architect-2**: "Distributed systems require integration testing for reliability."
- **reviewer-2**: "Protocol compliance is primary requirement."
- **researcher-2**: "MCP test suites emphasize integration testing patterns."

**FOR Unit-First (3 agents):**
- **coder-1**: "Unit tests provide fast feedback during development."
- **researcher-1**: "Test pyramid suggests unit tests as foundation."
- **optimizer-1**: "Unit tests execute faster, enabling rapid iteration."

**FOR Property-Based (1 agent):**
- **tester-1**: "Property-based testing finds edge cases in template rendering."

### Rationale
Integration-first wins due to the nature of MCP servers:

**Why Integration Testing Matters:**
1. **Protocol Compliance**: MCP has specific request/response formats
2. **End-to-End Validation**: Tools must work through full transport layer
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Integration tests catch serialization bugs
4. **Client Compatibility**: Verify actual AI assistant interactions
5. **Transport Variations**: Test stdio, HTTP, SSE implementations

**Test Structure:**
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ protocol_compliance.rs  # MCP spec conformance
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tool_execution.rs       # All tools via real MCP calls
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transport_stdio.rs      # stdio transport tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ error_handling.rs       # Error propagation through MCP
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schema_validation.rs    # JSON schema correctness
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parameter_parsing.rs    # Input validation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cache_eviction.rs       # Caching logic
â””â”€â”€ property/
    â””â”€â”€ template_rendering.rs   # QuickCheck for templates
```

**Integration Test Examples:**
- Send `tools/list` request, verify all 40+ tools present
- Execute `project_gen` with template, verify file creation
- Test `market_search` with offline cache
- Verify error responses for invalid parameters
- Test concurrent tool execution

**Unit Tests** still valuable for:
- Pure functions (parameter parsing, validation)
- Complex algorithms (cache eviction logic)
- Edge cases in business logic

**Property-Based Tests** for:
- Template rendering with random inputs
- SPARQL query generation
- Cache behavior under various loads
