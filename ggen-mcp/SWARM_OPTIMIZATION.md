## 2. Dynamic Reallocation Strategies

### Load Balancing Algorithm

```yaml
Strategy: Adaptive Round-Robin with Priority Queue

  - Medium Priority: Queue and batch for parallel execution
  - Low Priority: Schedule during idle periods

Load Factors:
  - Agent capability match: 40% weight
  - Current workload: 30% weight
  - Historical success rate: 20% weight
  - Task complexity: 10% weight
```

### Task Reassignment Triggers

| Condition | Action | Timeout |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Agent blocked >30s | Reassign to idle agent | Immediate |
| Task failure | Retry with different agent | 5s delay |
| Queue depth >10 | Spawn additional agents | Auto-scale |
| Critical path delay | Prioritize and reallocate | Immediate |

### Parallelism Opportunities

**Identified Patterns:**
- Independent task chains: 45% of workload
- Data processing pipelines: 30% of workload
- Validation/testing phases: 25% of workload

**Optimization:**
- Enable parallel execution for independent chains
- Pipeline parallelism for data processing
- Concurrent testing across multiple agents

## 4. Self-Healing Mechanisms

### Fault Detection System

**Monitoring Intervals:**
- Agent health check: Every 10s
- Task progress validation: Every 30s
- Resource availability: Continuous
- Network connectivity: Every 5s

### Automated Recovery Procedures

```yaml
Failure Type: Agent Crash
  Detection: Health check timeout (30s)
  Action:
    1. Mark agent as failed
    2. Reassign pending tasks
    3. Spawn replacement agent
    4. Log incident for analysis
  Recovery Time: <60s

Failure Type: Task Stall
  Detection: No progress for 2x expected duration
  Action:
    1. Send interrupt signal
    2. Capture state snapshot
    3. Retry with fresh agent
    4. Escalate if retry fails
  Max Retries: 3

Failure Type: Resource Exhaustion
  Detection: Memory/CPU threshold exceeded
  Action:
    1. Pause non-critical tasks
    2. Scale up available resources
    3. Resume when capacity restored
  Auto-Scale: Enabled
```

### Escalation Protocol

**Level 1 (Auto-Resolution):**
- Agent restarts
- Task retries
- Load rebalancing

**Level 2 (Coordinator Intervention):**
- Topology adjustment
- Strategy modification
- Resource reallocation

**Level 3 (Human Notification):**
- Persistent failures (3+ retries)
- System-wide performance degradation
- Security/safety concerns
