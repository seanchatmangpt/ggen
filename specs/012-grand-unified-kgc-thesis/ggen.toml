# NOTE: ggen v5 uses template-based generation with data passed from CLI or scripts.
# The 15 generation rules are defined in the templates themselves.
# To generate the thesis:
# 1. Templates in templates/ directory process the ontology data
# 2. Output files are written to output/ directory
# 3. Templates use Tera syntax with RDF data passed as context
