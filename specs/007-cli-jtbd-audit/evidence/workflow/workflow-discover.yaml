  parseable_output: 3     # Text-only output, no structured format
  error_messages: 10      # Good error messages naming --workflow_file requirement
  idempotency: 12         # Read-only operation would be fully idempotent

avatar_notes:
  claude_code: "File dependency blocks orchestration; no structured output format; cannot execute standalone"
  cursor_ai: "Help text clear but requires file setup; not practical for inline IDE usage"
  copilot: "Requires file context; limited pattern examples; difficult for completion-based learning"
  aider: "Requires pre-existing workflow file; cannot automate safely without file dependency"
  devin: "File dependency blocks autonomous execution; would need file creation logic first"
  openhands: "Text output requires manual parsing; needs file setup; difficult for standalone usage"
  windsurf: "IDE integration challenging due to file dependency; no structured output format"

maturity_level: "L1"
maturity_blockers:
  - "File-dependent execution blocks autonomous usage (L1 blocker)"
  - "No structured output format like JSON (blocks L2+)"
  - "Cannot execute standalone without external file"
