KEY FINDINGS
============

Finding 1: Synergistic Value
Individual components have moderate value (~3-4). Combined strategically,
they unlock capabilities far exceeding their parts (value 7-8).

Finding 2: Critical Path
Receipt + Tracking → Database → Analytics creates highest ROI path.
Start here for maximum leverage and quickest wins.

Finding 3: Foundation First
Docker + Reproducibility forms essential foundation for all other
combinations. Necessary for compliance and reliability.

Finding 4: 80/20 Principle
Top 8 combinations (26% of total) deliver 80% of maximum system value.
Remaining 22 combinations are long-term nice-to-haves.

Finding 5: Quick Phase 1 Win
First 2 combinations (Receipt + Docker) have ROI 4.0 with only 4 days
total effort. Complete Phase 1 to validate approach and build confidence.

NEXT STEPS
