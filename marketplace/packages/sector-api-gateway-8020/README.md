# Sector: API Gateway 8020

**Status**: 8020 Certified ✅
**Dark Matter Reduction**: Eliminates ~60% of gateway configuration work (12 hours saved per gateway)

## Overview

This bundle provides production-ready API gateway configuration that covers 80% of common gateway infrastructure needs. It eliminates the repetitive work of setting up routing, authentication, rate limiting, and observability, delivering a secure, scalable gateway in minutes instead of days.

## What Gets Generated

- **Gateway Configuration**: Complete Kong, Nginx, or Envoy configuration
- **Route Definitions**: Service routing with path-based and host-based rules
- **Authentication**: JWT validation, OAuth2, API key management
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user, per-endpoint, and global rate limits
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin policies with whitelist management
- **TLS/SSL**: Certificate management and automatic renewal setup
- **Load Balancing**: Service discovery and health-aware load balancing
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Header manipulation, body transformation
- **Observability**: Access logs, metrics export, distributed tracing
- **Security**: WAF rules, IP whitelisting, DDoS protection
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets for K8s deployment
- **Terraform Modules**: Infrastructure-as-code for cloud deployment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the bundle
ggen install sector-api-gateway-8020

# Generate API gateway for microservices
ggen generate api-gateway \
  --platform kong \
  --services user-service,order-service,payment-service \
  --auth jwt \
  --bundle sector-api-gateway-8020

# Deploy to Kubernetes
cd api-gateway
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Or deploy with Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Dark Matter Eliminated

### Before: 20 hours
- [ ] Research and choose gateway solution (3 hours)
- [ ] Install and configure gateway software (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up service routing and discovery (3 hours)
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization (4 hours)
- [ ] Configure rate limiting and quotas (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring (2 hours)
- [ ] Write deployment scripts and documentation (2 hours)

### After: 8 hours
- [x] Gateway configuration generated in < 5 minutes
- [x] All standard features pre-configured and tested
- [ ] Customize routing rules for specific services (2 hours)
- [ ] Fine-tune rate limits and security policies (2 hours)
- [ ] Integration testing with backend services (2 hours)
- [ ] Production deployment and validation (2 hours)

**Result**: 60% reduction in gateway setup work
